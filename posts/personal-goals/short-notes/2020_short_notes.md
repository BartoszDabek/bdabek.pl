First day of 2020 😲. I did 2 pretty important things today. First of all, I met with a friend of mine from high school and secondly I read my journal from 2019, which is quite interesting. It's interesting how my English developed throughout the year 😎.

02/01/2020
---
This year begins very much like the previous one. Once again I have a lot of work and I often go to the pool.😏🏊 

03/01/2020
---
I got sick 🤧! I woke up at 4 am with a cold but most of the day I felt pretty decent. Unfortunately, in the evening I felt terrible again 😭

04/01/2020
---
It was a very tough night 🤒. I think I was waking up like 10 times during the night 😒... Fortunately, I felt much better during the day, so I could write a review of 2019, which you can read [here](https://www.bdabek.pl/2020/01/04/podsumowanie-roku-2019/).

05/01/2020
---
It was a good Sunday 😍. In the morning I was in church and in the evening my cousin and his fiancee invited me. Of course I took the opportunity :)

06/01/2020
---
Today we had a national holiday 🇵🇱. Thanks to that I could focus on my goals for this week ❤🔥!

07/01/2020
---
First day at work after a long weekend. Today we had a sprint review and we didn't accomplish many tasks 😎. Anyway... Today I also celebrated Orthodox Christmas with my family. We went to dinner at my grandmother's where our whole family was 🤗!

08/01/2020
---
Today I had to fix a few bugs in the tasks I pushed recently. I had a deadline. I don't like working under pressure 😰 and I don't think anyone does 👊.

09/01/2020
---
I have to control my time at work!! Once again, I've worked for 12 hours or more and no one will pay me for that extra hours 😩

10/01/2020
---
Friday 😍😍! It was a very good day. With God's help, I solved all the problems at work and could start the weekend at 3 pm with a very good mood! In the evening I went to the pool with my cousins - we talked and rested 👍

11/01/2020
---
Today I was at the funeral of my distant uncle ⛪. It's good to think about death and keep that in mind in your life. We should try to live in a way that doesn't waste time and give happienes to others! 🙆🏻‍♂️

12/01/2020
---
👋Sunday. It actually was a sunny day 😄. Today, after church I talked to one of my friends, who showed me his house. I spent the rest of the day at home ;]

13/01/2020
---
The week has begun! Today I went to the Bialystok and I'll stay here until Thursday. Thanks God that I have my own apartment!! 👍

14/01/2020
---
It's been a busy but pleasant day. I had to be at the university today and by the way I passed one subject 👨‍🎓👍. I also had to work late (7-8pm) because during the day I studied instead of working 🤫

15/01/2020
---
It was a nice day. I worked in my client's office today - it's cool to be there once in a while 😉. Later I had to go to the university - I had a presentation in one subject about multithreaded programming. And at the very end of the day my friends came by (actually, a friend rents a room from me and his fiancée came by) and we had a good time 👍👊.

16/01/2020
---
Back home :). I love this place where I was born - it is quiet and peaceful. Nature is not yet so much disturbed by technological progress and the human hand. Today's entry is very 'poetic' 😅.

17/01/2020
---
Another good day 🙂. No special revelations. At work I did my job and I'm going safely to the weekend 💪. Tomorrow I'll be a wedding witness and today we had an entry attempts  - it's rather not stressful, after all it's not my wedding 😄👰🤵.

18/01/2020
---
Wedding day 💒🔔🔔! I was a witness today but thank God I wasn't stressed out :). A beautiful wedding and a good wedding! 😉

19/01/2020
---
Sunday :). Today we had dinner together with the guests and the wedding couple. It was okay 😊. I talked with many friends and I think I had a good time 👊. In the evening I went with my cousin to the pool 🏊🏊.

20/01/2020
---
It was a good Monday. I had some free time and thanks to that I could spent the evening with my friend and his fiance 👍👍.

21/01/2020
---
Another beautiful day 😊. This time I had more work than yesterday, but maybe that's a good thing, at least I didn't waste time on some stupidity. In the evening we went to a friend's for dinner. It was tasty and funny 🥘😅.

22/01/2020
---
The next day when I spent the evening at someone 😏. It's good because this year is supposed to be different from the previous one where I mainly devoted my time to study and work. This time the goal is different - to spend time with family, friends - people more or less close to me 👊.

23/01/2020
---
It's been a hard day. I was doing an urgent patch to the application + a few other things stopped working...😪😪 From the positive things I came back to my beloved Hajnówka ❤.

24/01/2020
---
Friday 🤗🤗! To be honest, I was very ineffective today. I solved the problems from yesterday (some of them solved themselves, I only got the information that it's ready) and then I took care of the organizational issues (docker, git). Sometimes it takes days like this to get a buzz off 🤯.

25/01/2020
---
Interesting Saturday 🙂. I guess I didn't do much - I was preparing to pass the subject for Monday and wrote a post on my blog, and yet I feel that I was productive 🤩. And in the evening, I went to the pool with my friends and then I bumped into friends for a while. 👊

26/01/2020
---
The wonderful day☺️. I could be at the service today and have lunch with my parents later. In the evening we went to listen to carols. It was a performance organized by the neighboring church. It was a very good time. 👍👍

27/01/2020
---
Yes! I passed the exam 👊! It's Monday and I felt very unproductive at work. I worked for really long time (10-12 hours?) and I feel like I did nothing 😪. At the end of the day, I noticed something very strange under my left eye - something like a bruise. I wonder, is it caused by fatigue or rather by sitting in front of the computer too long? 

28/01/2020
---
It was a bad day. I feel like I didn't do anything at work even though I worked 8 hours 😶... I also decided to come home earlier and I did - at 7pm I was in Hajnówka and spent the evening with my friends 🙂. 

29/01/2020
---
Today was much better than yesterday 👍👍. In fact, I was working on modifying one query to the database which took me a whole 8 hours. But at least I see some progress 🙂. Today I also went for a run with my friend - we ran about 4.5 km and then we went to the pool to take a bath 😂🤣.

30/01/2020
---
Today, with friends we went to visit our mutual friends together. We made pizzas 🍕🍕 and we had a nice evening ☺️! 

31/01/2020
---
Last day of January 😲! How quickly that time went by! Tonight I went to the pool again with my cousin 🏊.

01/02/2020
---
And it's the new month 👊! It was a nice day. I spent a lot of time studying or actually reading slides from the presentation - next week I will have 2 exams 👨🎓. In the evening - as is lately often - I went with my cousin to the swimming pool 💪💪 - I'm only worried about the fact that we go there mainly to relax and do not swim much...

02/02/2020
---
I'm in pain! After yesterday's pool, my back started hurting 😫😫! We were at my uncle's for his 50th birthday today. It was fun - we could meet the whole family but the pain was sometimes unbearable 😪.

03/02/2020
---
Monday. I was at a job interview today. I found out how much I don't know and after the interview I felt very bad - mentally - something like I lost some battle 😥. Nevertheless, this will always be a good thing, because now I'll go through all these topics myself and be richer with new knowledge 🤗!

04/02/2020
---
There it is! Finally I finished updating the documentation of the installation of our environments and at the same time I cleaned up some docker containers 👍👍.

05/02/2020
---
Tonight I got an answer after Monday's job interview. I was offered a junior position. It may seem like a step backwards but I think I can learn a lot there and I have to seriously consider 🤨🤨.

06/02/2020
---
The next day is over. Today, exceptionally, I wasn't going anywhere. I spent the whole day at home in front of the computer - I am not proud of it but I do not regret 😅. Slowly I have to present my mindset for writing my thesis 👨🎓.

07/02/2020
---
What a day it was... I took up a job and couldn't let go - one thing didn't work and it didn't leave me alone 😣. At the very end of the day I solved it 👍😊! Apart from that, I wrote about this job offer a few days earlier. I decided to reject it due to the lack of possibility to work remotely in 100% - and this is my goal. 

08/02/2020
---
A lot has happened today. In the morning, my cousin and I went to the countryside and we loaded the wood for firewood and then came back with a tractor 😄🚜. Then I went running with my friend and we did 6 km 🏃 (we had a very average time). At the end of the day - to relax - I went with my cousin to the pool 🤗.

09/02/2020
---
It was a wonderful Sunday 😍😍! It was very sunny. In the morning I was in the church and in the afternoon I went to see friends. At first we went for a walk and then we ate, talked and played some board games 😉.

10/02/2020
---
Today, however, the weather was terrible - it was raining and the wind was blowing. Despite everything I went running with my friend and we did 3.8km 🏃🏃. I think that this year's goal of 100km could have been raised to 200 😀.

11/02/2020
---
Ahhhh!! Today I almost reached the 50m underwater goal 🏊. I've swam 40-45 meters and surfaced. I'm a bit angry, because I still had oxygen to do 1-2 more repss. 💪💪

12/02/2020
---
It was a good day :). Nothing unusual happened, but still I'm satisfied. I spent the whole day at home and started to get acquainted with materials for my thesis 📗👍.

13/02/2020
---
Finally, I was able to finish the task at work - or actually pass it on for review 👍. Besides, it was an ordinary day and nothing interesting was going on 🙂.

14/02/2020
---
My roommate is sick and I feel that slowly this disease is also taking me 🤧🤧. Still, it was a good day 😉. Today I ran a little over 4.5km with my friend even though I did not feel 100% healthy 👍.

15/02/2020
---
And I got sick 😰🤒. I spent the whole day reading scientific papers on the subject of my thesis... My head is steaming after that day...🤯

16/02/2020
---
Today I felt much better - actually I almost recovered 🤗. Today I was only in church and spent the rest of the day at home 🏠. In the evening my cousin came to me and together we watched over my nephew 👶👶.

17/02/2020
---
It was a nice Monday 😎! It was very, VERY warm - 12 degrees in mid-February 🤯! I'm a little glad because I like it when it's warm and on the other hand I'm afraid for what's happening to the climate this year 😶.

18/02/2020
---
The next day passed 😏. Actually, I didn't do anything very valuable today. I finished a pdf with 10 keyboard shortcuts to IntelliJ and downloaded some repositories with the code to calculate k means 👍.

19/02/2020
---
Again, I haven't moved much from home, but I feel it was a good day 👍👍. We had some meetings at work today (in the meantime I did my home training), someone even went to my website and wrote a comment [bdabek.pl](bdabek.pl) 👊.

20/02/2020
---
Today I was at the pool with my cousin 💪. I could use this relaxation because today we had a lot of work with the git and all the branching 😮.

21/02/2020
---
Another good day! :) Today I was at the pool again - this time with my two buddies. My blog [bdabek.pl](bdabek.pl) has been approved for jvm-bloggers and gained a lot of traffic thanks to this 👍👍.

22/02/2020
---
Oh, yes! This Saturday started wonderfully 😍. It was sunny in the morning 😎 so I went running with my friend (we would have gone anyway), we did 6 km and then I went to him for breakfast. I started writing my thesis (I wrote one page 😅) and in the evening I went with my cousin to the pool to relax 🤗🤗.

23/02/2020
---
It was a good day until evening. I don't want to write what happened because it's private, but let's just say I'm a little angry.

24/02/2020
---
All day long it was very hard for me to focus 😥. At 4:30 p.m. I went running with a friend of mine and it took my emotions away. 

25/02/2020
---
This afternoon I went to Bialystok 🚗. It's time to start the last semester of studies! 👨🎓

26/02/2020
---
It's been a tough day 😨. It's mostly about work... it turned out that what I had to implement wasn't necessary. The biggest pain is that I analyzed it in terms of how to solve it and so I realized that we don't need it after 3 days 😪😭.

27/02/2020
---
As far as work is concerned, it was much better today 👍! After all, I know what to do 😉. In the evening I went with my cousin (who is getting married in July) to the pool to relax. ☺️

28/02/2020
---
It was a good Friday 😊👍! At work, I did everything according to plan so I had more time in the afternoon. Using it, I made myself a nice dinner. I spent the evening with my friends - we talked, played and ate unhealthy food 😆.

29/02/2020
---
Last day of February 😯! Today I went running with my friend - we did 5 km and finally endomondo started to measure the distance 🏃👍. During the day I wrote some of my thesis and in the evening - again with my friend - we went to the pool 🏊.

01/03/2020
---
Very standard Sunday - I was in church in the morning, then I studied and worked on the analysis of the Master's thesis code 😲. I do not like such Sundays 🤔... 

02/03/2020
---
Tough Monday 🤨. At work I was dealing with branches and a few people from the team didn't adjust to the git workflow and some inconveniences came out 😥.

03/03/2020
---
Today was much better :). Throughout the day I had meetings 🎧. Almost always after such a day my head explodes 🤯, and today it was fine 👍. After work we started the cycling season with my cousin 🚴🚴 - we drove a modest 20 km 🔥!

04/03/2020
---
It was a nice Wednesday 🤗. In the afternoon I went to Bialystok to study 🚗 and after class I went to my friends - on Wednesdays we have such meetings where we meet and talk about God 👍.

05/03/2020
---
I was in the office today 🤗. I had a conversation with my boss about my development in the company and so we talked in general. In the afternoon I cane home (to Hajnowka) and made myself an orange chicken 💪👨🍳.

06/03/2020
---
The last day of the HackerRank challenge 🤗 - that time has passed very quickly 😮! It turned out very well that this was the last day of the challenge because today we went to Silesia (and I will probably be more limited in time). In general this whole 'trip' is so spontaneous. I found out on Wednesday that there is such a possibility and I said - we are going! 😅

07/03/2020
---
It was wonderful Saturday ☺️. We are at Silesia and we have a really good time with God here. Also I've met new friends :)

08/03/2020
---
We stayed in Silesia until the evening 😲. But to be honest I don't regret it - we had a very good time there 😉👍.

09/03/2020
---
It was a great Monday 😉👍. I feel very spiritually built and I always want to have this state 💪. So this is a note to me - Bartek, at the end of the year, as you read this, mention the condition you have now, and if you do not have it, do it all to make this come back!

10/03/2020
---
I had a good day again, 😉! I skip work - everything was normal here. I spent the evening with my friend - we went to the pool and then we talked until late in the evening 👍.

11/03/2020
---
The world is scared of the coronavirus disease 😮. The Polish economy is going down like crazy - maybe it's time to invest some money on the stock market? 🤔

12/03/2020
---
Another great day 🤗🤗! Tonight I was in the church, then I went with my friend to the cauldron - the shelves were empty, people went crazy for fear of the virus 🙄.

13/03/2020
---
Friday 😎. It was very hard for me to work today - I couldn't concentrate on my work and I did little 🙄. I also invested some money in Orlen's shares today - I'm looking at it rather long term, we'll see what comes out of it 😏.

14/03/2020
---
The world has gone crazy 🤔. I am very curious to see if I will live to see the end of this year and be able to read my notes in peace if so thank God. It's getting weird in the world now 😥.

15/03/2020
---
It was a pleasant Sunday 🙂. In the morning I was in church, then we had a family dinner, then I visited my friend and in the evening I went to church again 👍👍.

16/03/2020
---
Monday 🧡! All in all, it was a good day. In the evening - despite the fact that I didn't have much desire - we got in the car with our friends and went to the forest to talk 😊.

17/03/2020
---
It was such a weird day 🤔. All the people around are panicking about the coronavirus 😶😶 - where does that get us all?

18/03/2020
---
Today it was beautiful outside - 15 degrees and you could feel the spring 😍😍. In the afternoon I went for a run, did 4 km. I was running and my cousin was riding a bike next door so we also talked a little 🙂.

19/03/2020
---
I really enjoyed today's 😉. The weather behind the window was poor but still I feel the spring is slowly coming 🤗. In the evening I could be at a service with my cousin, where the good word 👍 was preached.

20/03/2020
---
Friday 🤗🤗. We start the weekend! Today I invited my cousin to dinner and made MEGA delicious turkey with rice, mushrooms and broccoli 🔪👨🍳❤. Then we went for a walk in the forest - a great feeling 👍.

21/03/2020
---
Today I spent almost the whole day writing the algorithm for my thesis 🤯🤯. In the meantime, I did some other things, e.g. I cleaned the room 😆.

22/03/2020
---
It was a good Sunday 😉. In the morning, instead of going to church, we met in a group with friends (because of the ban on meeting more than 50 people). It was very nice (btw. I went there on foot 👟 - about 4 km one way). In the evening I had a short call with my thesis supervisor - he helped me a little with understanding the code 👍.

23/03/2020
---
It was a very productive day 💪🔥! I got up at 4:30am and started my day as always with one extra brick - a DNA course I bought yesterday. Besides, the day was like a day, everything was fine at work and after work I went to run with my friend and did 6 km 🏃🏃. I also managed to write a correctly naive version of the algorithm which I sat on yesterday with my promoter 😊.

24/03/2020
---
WoW! Today I managed to achieve one of my annual goals - to last 3:45 minutes without oxygen 👍👍! It's a pity that the pool is closed because I would probably be able to beat 50 meters underwater too 😏.

25/03/2020
---
The middle of the week and so far the hardest (in terms of time) day - I didn't even have time to do my training 😥. But I went running with my friend and we did 6.5 km 🏃. For the first time this year we ran together at my place.

26/03/2020
---
Today was a quiet day. I spent the whole day at home. A little study, a little blog - nothing special 😉.

27/03/2020
---
Time to start the weekend 😍! Today we went out on bikes with friends - we went to the forest 🤗. It is beautiful there! 

28/03/2020
---
Today we repeated the activity from yesterday and again we went by bike to the forest 🚴 - this time we did 30km. Later we made dinner at my place - it was quite good 👍.

29/03/2020
---
Oh, I didn't move at all today 😲 We had a family service at our house today so I just had to go down the stairs. It was a 'different' Sunday, but still very pleasant 😉. 

30/03/2020
---
And another Monday is behind us. 🙂 I had an online 'test' from the databases today - I think I did quite well 👍. 

31/03/2020
---
It was an ordinary day. I wasn't moving from home and I didn't do anything unusual 😶. I started my thesis a little bit, but no fireworks. Somehow today I missed the motivation to do 🤔.

01/04/2020
---
Wednesday is always a busy day 😓. You know, work and then classes... Just a little more and that's it 👍  !

02/04/2020
---
It was a good day 👍. During the day I went out to run with my friend and we did almost 6 km 💪. 

03/04/2020
---
There he is! Friday 😍. I had a good day again today. At work I started a topic that is difficult, but outside of work I have everything under control. Well, maybe outside of my MA thesis, which I planned to write this week and I barely started 🤨

04/04/2020
---
Today I did overtime at work 😮. Besides, I went out for a run with my friend and after the run we went to him and ate delicious homemade hamburgers 🍔.

05/04/2020
---
Wonderful Sunday 😍😍! In the morning we went to our uncle and auntie's, where we had a home service and then a family dinner. Later I came home on foot (about 5km) - but it was worth it - the weather was WONDERFUL 🤗🤗!

06/04/2020
---
Today was wonderful weather 😎😍! I don't even know what to write, but I know that the more this weather is outside, the less I want to study and work 😯. And I still have to finish my master's degree in 😪.

07/04/2020
---
Another great day! 👍 Today was even better weather than yesterday! Just today we had such a mini summer 😍😍. 

08/04/2020
---
Wednesday = little free time 😐. I had a colloquium from databases today + at work I'm also struggling with one bug on the production 😰... but soon a long weekend - on Friday I'm picking up overtime for the last Saturday 😉!

09/04/2020
---
Thank God it was a quiet day 😉. I solved yesterday's production problem and I can start a long weekend because tomorrow I'm taking a holiday 👍. 

10/04/2020
---
Today I spent the whole day writing my thesis ✍️.  In the afternoon I went cycling with my cousin and we drove 20 km through the forest 🌳🌲. 

11/04/2020
---
It's just beautiful 👌! Today I started to continue writing my thesis - I finished writing around noon. I thought I would write some more algorithm and it turned out that by the evening I had written a working algorithm in a single thread version 👍! And additionally, I ran 4km in the meantime and walked with my cousin for an hour on the tracks and forest 💪😊.

12/04/2020
---
First day of the Resurrection holidays 👍. We spent that day as a family. At first we had a service and then a family dinner 🍗🍗. It was a well spent Sunday 😉.

13/04/2020
---
And the second day of the holidays 👊🏼. This time we gathered at my parents' house. Just like yesterday, it was a cool time 👍🏼. 

14/04/2020
---
It was so hard for me to focus today 😫. I did almost nothing productive... I hope this is a temporary crisis 😅.

15/04/2020
---
It was rather a good day. It was hard for me to focus on work again... but at least this time I did some of the things on my todo list 👍🏼. 

16/04/2020
---
Today after work I went running and then I went to visit my friend. There was also my brother with his wife and child 😉. 

17/04/2020
---
I spent all day at home 🤔. I don't feel like writing anymore because this morning I got a little bit of a bad mood 😑.

18/04/2020
---
It was a strange day... Me and my friend went running to the woods to run and then on our way back we met the police 👮, who warned us that we can't do that. What a time...

19/04/2020
---
It was a bad start to the day... but thank God everything turned out to be better 😉. We were at Grandma's today - we had a service and then a family dinner 👍. Later in the afternoon I also went to visit my friend 👊.

20/04/2020
---
Time flies so fast...  It's almost the end of April. Today I was on a bike with my friend and we did 45 km 🚴🤯. I was very tired after coming back but also very happy 💪💪.

21/04/2020
---
It was just a regular Tuesday.The only place I moved out of the house was to go to my hairdresser... 🤔

22/04/2020
---
Wednesday - on this day I always have a lot on my mind because I still have 3 hours of studies outside of work. 😕 But today, despite the fact that I had to write a course pass and later present the progress of my MA thesis, I liked this Wednesday 😉.

23/04/2020
---
I'm glad that my pushups challenge is coming to an end 🤗. In recent days I have been short of vitamins because of exhaustion and some of my muscles have been vibrating e.g. while sitting 😯😯.

24/04/2020
---
Friday 🤗🤩! Not much happened today - I didn't even leave the house today (and it was warm outside, only there was no sun). I refreshed my website - I added and modified a new theme. Now it looks really cool 👍👍.

25/04/2020
---
Nice Saturday, 👍. Today I'm finishing my challenge with pumps. 💪 Together with my friend we ran 8 km today 😮 - although our pace was poor... but the distance counts. I also wrote several subsections of my thesis today ✍🏻👊🏻

26/04/2020
---
A wonderful Sunday - and I don't mean today's weather. In the morning I went with my dad to church 😊, and then I went to dinner to my family. In the evening, I took a walk during which a lot of ideas came up. Lesson learned to do more such walks 👍👍

27/04/2020
---
Monday 😍! I hope this is going to be a good week. Looking at the weather forecast, this is how it will be 👍🤗. And today's day didn't have any fireworks so I have nothing to describe 🙋♂.

28/04/2020
---
Nice day 😉. I cycled with my cousin today - we did about 30 km 🚴👍.

29/04/2020
---
Wednesday 😪. Outside the window it got ugly and yet, as always, on Wednesday, I had a lot of classes 😫. But it wasn't such a bad day in general 🙄.

30/04/2020
---
It is time to prepare for the next long weekend 👍🏼. That's good because I have some things to do (writing my thesis)...🏃🏽

01/05/2020
---
And we have May 😍! I think it's one of the most beautiful seasons... Today was a job holiday in Poland, so I didn't work 🤗, instead I wrote an article on my blog and tried to write my MA, but nothing came out of it 🤔.

It was an insanely productive day 👊🏼💪🏼! I finished writing the chapter of my thesis, wrote tests for the algorithm, improved it so that there are no thread races... and additionally, I went for a walk and walked about 6 km (it's beautiful in the forest 😍).

03/05/2020
---
Today we celebrated my nephew's birthday and my 😊. I have a birthday tomorrow and my nephew on Wednesday. We had a nice family time 😉.

04/05/2020
---
Today is my birthday 😉. Let me put it this way - I am grateful to God for the whole 26 years I have had - I have a wonderful life and family 🤗! And now let's go back to today. In the afternoon the weather got wonderful 😍😍 and together with my friend we went running - we did 9 km 😯!

05/05/2020
---
I don't know what to say about today. The day wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either... I know for sure I wasn't very productive and somehow I didn't feel like doing anything 😥😥.

06/05/2020
---
It was a very hard day and not only because I had a class today. Around noon I started to feel very bad and it kept me going until the evening, but thank God the evening was all right 🤗. 

07/05/2020
---
It wasn't the best day. I got busy and didn't even go out into the fresh air. I have a lot on my mind lately - I have to start telling others no and slowly empty my stack 🤯.

08/05/2020
---
And today, on the contrary, it was a good day ☺️. Today I also spent the whole day at home but still felt better mentally, hmm..😏

09/05/2020
---
It was good Saturday, 👍. I finished the second chapter of my thesis 🤗. In addition, we went on bikes with my cousin 🚴, but we had an interesting adventure... About 15 km from home a tire got punctured. Fortunately, my dad came and took the bike 🙏🏼.

10/05/2020
---
It was by far the best Sunday this year 🤗🤗 both in terms of weather and how I spent it 👍🏼. We had a family meeting in the morning and then lunch together. Later I went cycling with my friends and we had a nice afternoon and evening 💪🏼💪🏼! 

11/05/2020
---
A wonderful day - weather like in summer 😍😍! I didn't take too much advantage of it because today I focused very much on work and didn't even go out to run 😒😒.

12/05/2020
---
Amazing, it was snowing this morning ❄️🤯! It was a good day - I even went and ran 3 km (to get rid of stress from work).

13/05/2020
---
That was the worst day in a long time 😓. I removed the wrong table from the database by my ignorance, so I worked until tonight...

14/05/2020
---
Today it wasn't easy again, but thank God all problems at work were finally solved 🙏. After work - to relax - I went with my cousin on bikes and then I made a home kebab 🔪! It was tasty !!!! 👍🏼👍🏼 

15/05/2020
---
Friday 😍. I waited a long time for this day - because it was a tough week. Today, after work, I went on a bike and drove 17 km 🚴🚴. I think that sport is just some way to relieve the stress 😏.

16/05/2020
---
This Saturday wasn't promising to be an interesting day - the weather was cloudy and not encouraging 🌫️... Until the afternoon I sat at home and wrote my thesis ✍🏽. Later my cousin proposed to go to Bialowieza and we did it. We went in 4 to Bialowieza and came from the village - together we walked 7 km! When we came back, I went running with my friend 🏃🏃, so in the end it was an intense day 🤗.

17/05/2020
---
A wonderful Sunday 🤗😍! We were all family today at Grandma and Grandpa's. It was a really good family time (and later a very good dinner 👍🏼). Later I came home and with God's help I managed to write the last algorithm for my thesis! Yupii! 😀😀

18/05/2020
---
It was definitely a nice Monday 😍! Weather was lousy but still I had a lot of energy :). Additionally there were also customers to watch the apartment for rent 😏.

19/05/2020
---
Ahhh... It was a weird day 🤔, nothing was wrong but on the other hand it wasn't good either. I had a technical interview today and it went wrong - that's probably the reason.

20/05/2020
---
Surprisingly, it was good Wednesday 🙂. I always had a lot of work to do for the class but this time everything went somehow smoothly + I still ran 4 km during the class 👍🏽.

21/05/2020
---
It was a good day. Everything was calm and in the afternoon I went out with my cousins on a bicycle 👍 (although it was very windy and not easy to ride).

22/05/2020
---
Beautiful Friday! 😊. Maybe the weather wasn't the best, but finally the weekend starts 😋. I noticed that I need to focus more on the details of what I do - a note for the future.

23/05/2020
---
This was by far the best Saturday of the year 😍😍! In the morning, I grasped the things I had to do and then it started. I went with my cousin's bike to my grandmother's 🚴, then I went to play beach volleyball with my friends, then to barbecue to them and at the end I went to a friend from my teenage years and we could remember the old days... Beautiful day 🤗!

24/05/2020
---
And another wonderful day 😍. For most of the day the weather was bad but in the evening the sun was shining. In the morning I was in church and then at my cousin's birthday party. And in the evening I went for a walk 🤗🤗.

25/05/2020
---
It's amazing how quickly that time passes. It was an ordinary Monday without revelation - in the evening I went to run 4 km 🙃.

26/05/2020
---
Hmm... I don't know what to say about today - it was okay. Out of the cooler things, today I went on bikes with my cousin 😅.

27/05/2020
---
Another good day :). It's probably another Wednesday when the combination of work and study is not a kind of challenge 😏. Maybe because I focus a little less on studies 🤫...

28/05/2020
---
Unexpected overtime at work came to me today 😮. Actually, I'm glad because I just needed those extra hours 😄. 

29/05/2020
---
It's cool because Friday, but we have a big topic at work and we have to do overtime on Saturday 🤔🤔.

30/05/2020
---
Ahhh... what a day. It's been raining all day 😕. It wouldn't change much in my life because I've been working from morning to evening anyway. One more thing... I was wrong and the blog posting went 5 hours later than I planned. 🙄

31/05/2020
---
And the last day of May 😮! It was a beautiful Sunday. In the morning I was in the church and in the afternoon we went to the neighboring church and had a good time together with the youth. There was a grill and volleyball 🤗👍🏻.

1/06/2020
---
Today I listened to an interesting episode of the podcast [TPS](https://www.asianefficiency.com/podcast/301-journaling/) about keeping such an everyday diary. I want to check how certain things will work out for me, so now in such daily notes I'll always briefly mention yesterday - what I managed to do or what I am grateful for (because I always write my diary in the morning) and then one plan for today 👍🏼. So today's plan is to write a thoughtful agenda for the blog post.

2/06/2020
---
It took all day yesterday to write application audit logs... and as it turned out, in the end it doesn't work anyway 😣! Yesterday, instead of finishing work normally at 3:00 p.m. I was sitting on those logs until 9:00 p.m... it was a mistake. That's why I didn't do yesterday's plan which was to write an agenda for the blog. That's why I'm postponing it until today.

3/06/2020
---
Yesterday's day was much better ☺️. I finished my work at normal time, went running with my friend, made small changes in the algorithm for my thesis and yet I wrote the agenda for the post blog 👍🏼👍🏼. Today I want to improve the test scenarios for my thesis and write one section of the blog post 💪🏼. 

4/06/2020
---
Yesterday's day was cool 😏. I took a light and pleasant topic at work. After work I went to play beach volleyball, then I went out with my cousin on bicycles and at the end of the day I corrected the scripts for my thesis. Yesterday I didn't manage to write a blog so today I will have to write the majority - we can do it 😎.

5/06/2020
---
Another nice day. Yesterday, thank God, I didn't have much work 😉. I wrote some content for a blog article and in the evening I went for a walk in the forest 🌳🌳. Today I will finish the blog and enjoy this beautiful Saturday! 😎😍

6/06/2020
---
That day was exactly as I described it - I wrote an article and then from noon to evening something was still going on - bike, volleyball, sunbathing, grill 😍🤗. Something wonderful! Such moments are beautiful! There are no plans for today. It is Sunday - the Lord's day. If I do something, it is only as an additional activity 😉.

7/06/2020
---
Wonderful, beautiful Sunday 😍😍! The whole day was very sunny 😎. Yesterday, despite the fact that I didn't plan to do so, I managed to correct the scripts and write an article on the blog. Today I'm going to read an article about architects' guild and enter results of some scripts into excel. 👍

8/06/2020
---
Another beautiful day 🤗. I didn't manage to read the article about architects' guild, but I made a beautiful template for test results 😁. The plan for today is simple - finish reading the article and run at least 5 km 🏃🏃.

9/06/2020
---
It's been a bit stupid for me to write it again in a row but it was another great day 😅 . Yesterday I ran over 6 km and read the article + additionally I rewrote the test results to excel 👍. Plan for today - clean up the room, pack up for the trip (I'm going to the mountains and from tomorrow to Sunday I don't use a computer) and ride 30 km by bike 🚴🚴.

10-13/06/2020
---
Yesterday I did not manage to ride my bike because of the weather - it was raining heavily from noon to evening 😒. By the way - I am changing the dates in this diary so that yesterday's day is really yesterday. But it is not important at this point - the most important is that I am going to the mountains :). I will not use the computer until Sunday - and that is the goal. Turn off and cut off completely from the Internet life 🙂. I'm off, bye! 👋

14/06/2020
---
I just got back from the mountains. It was wonderful. I completely calmed down + we got some mountain summits 🙃🙃. The views are indescribable ☺️.

15/06/2020
---
As for yesterday, I don't have much to say. After the trip I went to sleep and slept for a long time 😆. Plan for today - finish the project for the studies and prepare for its presentation and additionally make an agenda for the blog entry. 👊🏽

16/06/2020
---
The plan for yesterday was done 💪. The whole day yesterday was fine - I cycled 20 km 🚴. Today I want to make corrections after my promoter's comments to my thesis and write one section in the blog post.

17/06/2020
---
Yesterday, there was beautiful weather since the afternoon 😍. I took full advantage of both the weather and the fact that I was on holiday 😎😎. But today I have to get back to work 😋. The plan for today is to complete all the studies and finish writing (or maybe more exploring) yesterday's blog post.

18/06/2020
---
And again, a beautiful day. I went cycling with my cousin today and when we were coming back we were caught in heavy rain 😆. Although I got wet, I'm still happy 😅😅. Yesterday I did not manage to do anything with the blog post, so this is my main mission today.

19/06/2020
---
Yesterday I ran over 5 km 🏃, wrote a large part of the article on the blog and at the end of the day I came up with an idea to solve the problem at work 😀. Aah because I didn't mention it - for most of the day I was struggling with an architectural problem at work and I couldn't think of anything... The goal for today: to finish writing an article on the blog ✍🏽.

20/06/2020
---
Yesterday I failed to achieve my goal. But nothing happened. I'll do it today 👍. Why didn't I succeed? I've read a lot about what I'm writing and spent a lot of time debugging the code. So the plan for today is to finish the blog article and enjoy the day - go cycling or something 😎😍.

21/06/2020
---
Yesterday's day was 100% successful 👊. The last days are really beautiful and sunny - I love it 😍! Today is Sunday so I have no plans - I'll just enjoy life and see what comes out 😉.

22/06/2020
---
Yesterday, unfortunately, the weather wasn't good. It was warm but cloudy and rainy - only in the evening the weather became pleasant 😏. Nevertheless, yesterday's Sunday was fine - I was 2x in church at the morning and evening service 🙃. And what are my plans for today? Write an agenda for the blog post and if the weather is good, go out on a bike.

23/06/2020
---
The whole day yesterday was cloudy but there was no rain and thanks to that I could go out with my cousin on a bike 😏. The plan for today is to finish writing an article on the blog 👍🏻.

24/06/2020
---
Yesterday it was cloudy and quite cold for the last days 😢. Thanks to that I managed to write a post on the blog 😆. Plan for today: run at least 6 km and write a subsection of my thesis 👨🎓.

25/06/2020
---
I didn't manage to fulfill 100% of yesterday's plan because I didn't write a sub-section of my thesis - at least I buried it there a bit and changed the sequence diagram. BUT I managed to run 10km below 50 minutes 🏃💪🏼 yesterday - so the annual plan is done! And the goal for today is, of course, to finish writing this subsection of my MA thesis 😉.

26/06/2020
---
God gave another beautiful day yesterday 😍😍. I did everything I planned and additionally I cycled 30 km with my cousin 🚴. The plan for today is to propose cooperation on the blog and prepare a new project for the blog ☺️.

27/06/2020
---
And the weekend started - it started beautifully. Yesterday's weather was Wonderful 😍. I managed to carry out another annual plan - to ride 600 km by bike during the year 🚴. I also talked to my friend about the cooperation on the blog and I see that it goes in the right direction 👍. What about today? I have an article to read about transactionality and then the wedding! 😁👰

28/06/2020
---
Yesterday (and practically still today) I was at the wedding 🤵♂ 👰♂️. It was fun 👍🏻👍🏻. Plan for today? Enjoy a beautiful and sunny Sunday 😎🤗.

29/06/2020
---
It was a good Sunday 😏. I was at the wedding rehearsals and really enjoyed the beautiful weather all day. Thank God I also had the desire and opportunity to be at both services 🙂. Plan for today: write an agenda for the blog.

30/06/2020
---
This is the last day of the month 😮! Time flies incredibly fast so it's worth enjoying moments... As for yesterday I didn't manage to do anything with the agenda for the blog, and today I certainly won't do it either. Today I will have two technical talks so the plan for today is no plan 🤣.

01/07/2020
---
Yesterday's day wasn't an easy one 🤯, but I think I did quite well on both interviews I had 👍.Today I have one more conversation waiting - but a little less important 🤫. The plan for today is to finally write an agenda for the blog 😅.

02/07/2020
---
So far I have a very good week... Yesterday's technical interview went quite well and I had feedback response from the other interview which is not that bad (it's quite good actually). Yesterday mission to write agenda for the blog is done :). Today mission is to write a whole blog post because on Friday I'm at the wedding (again).

03/07/2020
---
I couldn't do yesterday's task with writing a blog 😢. I didn't even start it... Yesterday's day was very busy and in fact, when I finished work at 15, I didn't turn on the computer for my own purposes. The plan for today is to write +/- valid article and have fun at the wedding 🤣👍.

04/07/2020
---
Yesterday I got up at 4 a.m. and I was getting up at 4 a.m. and I still didn't have enough time for everything 🙄. And yet, I managed to do yesterday's goal - to write an almost finished article for the blog. The mission for today is to finish and 'polish' the details and later on the bike and wedding rehearsal. 

05/07/2020
---
Yesterday was wonderful 🤗. I went by bike to the wedding rehearsals. We had a beautiful weather and I spent time from noon to very evening in a nice atmosphere. Thank God for all this 🙏. Today is Sunday, so it is standard - no plan for today - we enjoy life 🙂🙂.

06/07/2020
---
I had a tough night - I got up and felt like I was going to throw up 😨🤒. It's a little better now - I still have a slight headache but I believe God will help me. The plan for today is simple: write an agenda for a blog.

07/07/2020
---
Monday passed very pleasantly - it was the last such hot day, now for the next few days the temperature will be lower 😢. Yesterday I managed to write an agenda for my blog and ride a few kilometers by bike ✍🏼💪🏼. The plan for today is to finish the article on the blog 🙂. 

08/07/2020
---
Yesterday it was cloudy and I had this feeling for a while that it was like autumn. But it's summer and now I see the beautiful sun outside 😍. I couldn't achieve yesterday's plan in 100%, so today I will finish writing an article for the blog.

09/07/2020
---
Again, I failed to complete the plan - to write a blog. I forgot to write about it earlier, but on July 7 I managed to finish my annual sports goal - to run 200km 💪🏼🏆. I am very pleased with it 🤗. The plan for today is the same as yesterday - to finish this blog post. 

10/07/2020
---
I finally managed to finish the article on the blog 😛. That's good because this week I have to write a subsection of my thesis and at the weekend I have another wedding 😅.Well, I actually wrote plan for today - my thesis.

11/07/2020
---
I wrote or maybe modified a little bit of my thesis yesterday, but I haven't managed to finish the whole chapter I planned. In fact, I have 2 drawings left to complete and that's it - I will have 3 chapters of the thesis finished. Today will be my cousin's wedding - I hope it will be a blessed time 🙂. 

12/07/2020
---
Yesterday I completed the third chapter of my thesis and then the wedding 👰. It was a different wedding... there wasn't much going on at it 🤔. But for me it doesn't matter that much - I talked to my friends and at least it ended earlier, so I got some sleep 😅😅.

13/07/2020
---
Yesterday we had a very pleasant Sunday 😎. There was a barbecue and there were wedding rehearsals. In the evening - thank God - I could give my testimony in the church 🙂. The plan for today is a Monday standard - write an agenda for a blog.

14/07/2020
---
Yesterday I had a crazy day at work - all day long we were fighting with production bugs 🤯🤯! Fortunately, we managed to patch everything up 🤓. Yesterday I did not start the blog. In the evening my friends arrived and I decided that they are more important 😛.

15/07/2020
---
Yesterday's day was good 👍🏻. I read a lot, enjoyed the day and of course I worked 😋. In the evening the weather became beautiful so I went on a bike 🚴. The plan for today is to finally write this agenda on a blog and maybe something more than that 😊.

16/07/2020
---
It was a wonderful day 😍😎! All day long the weather was BEAUTIFUL! In the evening I managed to write an agenda for the blog entry. I also had a meeting with my friend Marek, with whom I will run the blog together - such a 30-minute online meeting. The plan for today is to write an article ✍🏻👈🏼.

17/07/2020
---
Another nice day 🙃. Nothing unusual has happened. I managed to write an article and that makes me very happy 😋👍. The plan for today is to start writing a chapter on the results of my thesis 👊🎓.

18/07/2020
---
Yesterday was a very successful day. I had a peaceful day at work and after work it was also great 🤗. In the evening the weather outside became wonderful, so I read a book in the backyard and wrote some master's thesis 🙃. It's just like yesterday in short. What about today? Now it's 6:20 in the morning, I'm just sitting with coffee, nutella, peanut butter, honey and rice waffles 😍😍. I just ran 5 km and now I'm planning my day. The main goal for today - to edit an article on the blog before publication - is to provide details. And after that, enjoy the day 👍👍!

19/07/2020
---
Yesterday was a wonderful day 😍. Until noon, I had such productivity and so much energy that I am in shock 😲. Later on it was ok, but a little bit worse than in the morning - I'm rather a morning 'bird'. Today I am going to the neighboring church where the baptism will take place and I will probably spend the whole day there ⛪.

20/07/2020
---
Yesterday was exactly what I thought 😛. I spent the whole day in a neighboring church. I came home for the evening and went on a bike 😁. The weather for the last few days is a real miracle 😍😍😍! Plan for today - optimize the website of the blog 💪.

21/07/2020
---
Yesterday was probably the last day of such beautiful summer weather in the near future. Now there's no sun outside the window and it's cloudy, but maybe this will motivate me to do 😏😏. The plan for today is to write as much content as possible for the blog ✍🏻.

22/07/2020
---
Yesterday was fun. I had a negotiation with a current client and they offered me an interesting offer... even very interesting, where I can learn a lot and make good money 👍🏻. In 2 days' time I'm supposed to give an answer what I'm doing... At the end of the year, when I will make a summary, we will see if I chose well 😄 . And today's plan is to write a blog post because yesterday it didn't work out.  

23/07/2020
---
Yesterday, all day long I was thinking about what decision to make in connection with the change of job 🤯. It's Thursday morning and today I'll give you an answer, but I'm not convinced about the decision 🤔... Today I'm going to finish my blog post - yesterday I started and described a bit 👍.

24/07/2020
---
Yesterday, everything was already in my head and I know what decision I will make today - I am moving on to a new job. Admittedly, it is a distant perskeptic, because only since November, but the handle has come - time for new challenges 😅. As for the goal for today - to finish all the details of the blog entry (tomorrow I will probably not be at my computer all day).

25/07/2020
---
Yesterday I managed to write a subsection of my thesis 🤗! Besides, I cycled, finished the details of the article on the blog and made the decision to change my job to the end. A lot of things happened as for Friday. As I mentioned today, I won't be sitting at the computer much, because at 8 o'clock I'm going for a canoeing trip 💪🏼 💪🏼. The plan for today is simple - have fun and take a break from the constant work and pursuit of goals 🙃.

26/07/2020
---
Yesterday, the canoeing was great 😍! The whole day was very cool ☺️. Today is Sunday so it is also without a plan 😅. You have to enjoy and enjoy the weather because it is wonderful 😎🤩!

27/07/2020
---
It was a very nice Sunday. In the afternoon I went to my cousins' grill - I ate, talked and had fun 🤣. Today I have to get back to reality 🙄. The plan for today is to improve the blog post and prepare the introduction to the new ✍️.

28/07/2020
---
The weather was nice yesterday until noon but then something broke down 😭. I couldn't go out on my bike... but I'm gonna get it today! The plan for today is to write an agenda for a blog (or preferably the whole post 😅).

29/07/2020
---
Yesterday was okay. Nothing unusual happened. I was sticking to my plan and I'm planning the same thing today ✔️. I am going to write 2/3 of the article on my blog 👍.

30/07/2020
---
Yesterday I didn't manage to write a word in the blog article. Instead, I was exploring the subject and reading articles on it. Admittedly, I started a little bit late because about 20, but well... before that I enjoyed the day and I worked 😋. The plan for today is to write most of the article.

31/07/2020
---
End of next month 😮. Quickly. The plan for yesterday was not fully implemented so today I have to finish the whole article.

01/08/2020
---
I'm going to be baptized today. This is probably the most important day of my life. That's why I tried to get most things done yesterday or before. The plan for today is to be baptized with dignity. 

02/08/2020
---
Thank God for yesterday's 🙏🙏! It gave a wonderful weather and I could be baptized together with 4 other people 🙂🙂. As for today's plans, there are no plans 😛. I will be resting and enjoying the day with my family.

03/08/2020
---
Yesterday God gave another beautiful day 😍😍! We hosted a family from Silesia and had dinner together with our grandparents. But today it's time to get back to normal. It's 12 minutes past 6 am. I've already travelled 4 km and now it's time to start working. For today, the plan is as standard as it is on Monday. I want to write an agenda for a blog.

04/08/2020
---
Yesterday I had a good day - I was running, cycling and I managed to write an agenda for the blog 🤗! Today the weather is not so encouraging and I think I will spend more time on a blog article to write something there (although I have to read a lot more before).

05/08/2020
---
Yesterday it was ugly but warm outside 😋 and thanks to that I went to run - I did 4 km 🏃. I didn't manage to write anything on the blog, but that's because I read a lot and studied. The plan for today is to write the whole article 💪🏻💪🏻!

06/08/2020
---
Yesterday I managed to write the whole article in terms of content. All that remains today is to finish the summary and format the whole article 🙃. In addition, today I want to read two articles that I have written for this week, so that tomorrow only writing my thesis remains.

07/08/2020
---
Yesterday was beautiful 😍!There was beautiful sunshine outside all day long and I did everything I planned ❤️👍! The plan for today is - apart from enjoying the weather - to write my thesis. I have to make some charts and write something there ✍️.

08/08/2020
---
Yesterday was another beautiful day 😎😍! I didn't manage to write my thesis as I planned, but at least I tried 😂! I even made a table and entered the data into it! What about today? Today I am going to Augustow with my brother and his wife 🙂. We'll enjoy the weather!

09/08/2020
---
It was great in Augustow! There was some family and friends and we had a good time together. It's been a long time since I was so much in the water 😁😁. The weather was good for us 🙂👍! Today is Sunday and as standard there are no plans - although it would be nice to do something positive 😅.

10/08/2020
---
I had a great time this Sunday - I'm happy 👍. Thank God I could be in church morning and evening. After the morning service I was at my cousins' for a delicious dinner 🍴❤️! Later I wrote my thesis a little bit more, and so Sunday was done. And what is the plan for today? Master's thesis + enjoy the weather!

11/08/2020
---
Yesterday's day was cool 👍. I cycled 30 km, prepared charts for my MA thesis (the first one is always the most difficult one) and had an honest conversation with a friend. Today I would like to write a little article on my blog and squeeze my thesis. And now I go running 🏃😁!

12/08/2020
---
My legs hurt after yesterday's 😅. Yesterday I was running, did a leg training and yet I was cycling. A bit much for one day 😋 but what - there is nice weather so I use it! 😍😍 Today I'm not making any plans - I made an appointment with my friend for a bicycle and I assume it may take us all evening 🙄🙃.

13/08/2020
---
Yesterday's day deserves a special mention. Finally, I acted like a man and explained with a friend where we stand and where we are going. I am glad that this has happened and I hope that when I will read these notes at the end of the year it will be a nice memory. Anyway, when it comes to choosing a partner, I believe in God and that He will lead the way. And back to reality, the plan for today is to write as many as possible an article on the blog... 🙂.

Another nice day behind us 😉. Yesterday I managed to write the content for the article and for today there are only minor corrections. Besides, today I'm off work and I'm going to go out on a bike with a friend. And in the evening I'm going to the bachelor party 😁😁!

15/08/2020
---
Yesterday's day was SUPER! 😍😍 In the morning we cycled over 80km with a friend - we went to the border with Belarus 😛. At the bachelor party we were on a laser tag, then on go-karts and finally we went to eat something. Go-karts are really great fun - I was on them for the first time but I immediately loved it 😁😁! Today is Saturday and it's time to get back to reality. In a moment my cousin comes to me with her friends for breakfast and then I will continue writing my thesis! 🙂

16/08/2020
---
Unlike the whole week, this Saturday was frankly lazy and I liked the way I spent it on average 🙄. Admittedly, I wrote a bit of my thesis and ran 5 km but it wasn't that. Today is Sunday and by default I don't plan anything for Sunday 😝.

17/08/2020
---
Time to start the new week 🤗. Yesterday it was sunny again and thank God I could be at two services: morning and evening. Besides, I wrote a bit of my thesis so I'm getting close to the end of 🙂. What about today? Today I would like to finish the chapter concluding my thesis!

18/08/2020
---
Yesterday God gave us another beautiful day 👍👍! Today it's quite different outside the window - you can't see the sun, which made it harder for me to get out of bed 😅. Yesterday I managed to write an English summary, introduction and conclusion of my thesis 🤗! This means that I only have a few charts left to make as soon as the calculations on the server are finished. Great! The plan for today is to prepare a draft article for the blog.

19/08/2020
---
Yesterday wasn't as sunny as the whole week before but it was hot 😏. I managed to recognize the topic around the blog article and describe what I will write about 😜. For today I invited my cousins to a home-made kebab for dinner - we'll see what it comes out of 😁😁. The plan for today is to write one section of the article on the blog and then make a kebab 😂.

20/08/2020
---
And yesterday was great. I spent the whole evening in the good company of girls 🤣.We celebrated our cousin's birthday. The plan for today is to go out on a bike and write an article on a blog.

21/08/2020
---
Yesterday was my brother's birthday and it just so happened that he came back from the seaside for the evening so we celebrated a little bit 😋. I didn't want to write an article on the blog yesterday so it stays with me for today. Today I took a vacation at work and I'm going to the wedding at 2pm! 😍 🤵👰

22/08/2020
---
Yesterday's wedding was beautiful. Beautiful place, beautiful young couple and all the time spent was something wonderful 🙂👍. Today is the day after the wedding and we will all meet together again, I think we will have a good time. I have no extra plans for today and I don't want to - I will enjoy the day! 🤗

23/08/2020
---
Saturday was very pleasant - except maybe one exception... About half the people after the wedding got food poisoning 😅 - including me. This resulted in frequent visits to the 😂 toilet. Still, it doesn't change that the day was beautiful and thank God for that! Today we have a Sunday and as always on Sundays - no plans and what comes out will come out 🙂.

24/08/2020
---
Yesterday I invited family and friends for coffee. We sat and talked - maybe not as I fully imagined it, but it was quite ok 👍. We also made waffles - they were cool although I don't like waffles (I prefer something healthier 😛). And coming back to today - the plan is to read the thesis, make eventual corrections and send to the promoter.

25/08/2020
---
I couldn't make the plan yesterday but I have a good excuse 🙂. Yesterday was one of the last such sunnier days, so I went on bikes with my friend - we were riding and talking 🙃. And actually the whole afternoon and evening went down on it. So I am moving yesterday's plan for today 👍.

26/08/2020
---
Yesterday the weather was average for most of the day but thank God the evening got a bit nicer so I went out on a bike with a colleague 🚴🚴. I also managed to do my plan and send my thesis to the promoter. Plan for today is to write an agenda for the blog :).

27/08/2020
---
Yesterday's day was one of the few days this month when I didn't have any physical activity (bicycle / running) so in the evening I went for a 2 km walk. Actually, yesterday wasn't much happening... I was working and besides that I made the plan I assumed - i.e. write an agenda for a blog. Today the plan is to write the first sub-item.

28/08/2020
---
Yesterday I did not manage to complete the plan so today I would like to write the whole article. Yesterday we also had guests - my dad's brother and his wife. On this occasion sitting with them I ate some cake and for the last 2 days I have not had any physical activity and feels bad about it 😂. So today I want to do 40 km by bike 🚴.

29/08/2020
---
Yesterday's weather wasn't very good ( it' s the end of the summer so I don't even expect it to be sunny and warm) but it was good enough to go out on a bike 😅. I did the 40 km I assumed this morning. I also managed to write most of the article on the blog - although I won't say, I started to do it around 8 pm 🤫. The plan for today is of course to finish the blog article and additionally I want to plan a budget for the next month 👍. 

30/08/2020
---
Yesterday, despite the rainy weather, I had a good day 🙂. In the evening we had a youth meeting where I could share my testimony about how God saved my life and freed me from the sin of pornography. And thank God for giving me the courage to do so! Besides, I planned my budget for September and finished the article on the blog 👍. Today is Sunday as a standard day of rest, I hope that something will happen and I will be able to meet with my friends.

31/08/2020
---
WoW, this is the last day of August 😦! The holiday period passed very quickly... If you don't look at it, a lot has happened during this time in my life - we'll see how I'll remember it at the end of the year with the annual summary 😛. As for yesterday, I could be at a friend's place for dinner - we celebrated their mom's birthday. It was a nice time. The plan for today is to finish reading the Springs documentation and go out on a bike with my childhood friend and tell him about God 🙂.

01/09/2020
---
Yesterday I went out on a bike with my childhood friend. We had a few adventures e.g. rain or a tube that came out of my tire so I had to come back for a second bike 😅. But while riding I could also tell him a little bit about God and it was cool because he listened to 🙂. I also managed to make the plan I had set myself for yesterday and even more 😛. Today I would like to write a part of the article on my blog.

02/09/2020
---
Yesterday I didn't manage to carry out the plan I had planned - i.e. to write parts of the article on the blog 🤔. Although I can say that I had a reason for that - a roommate moved in with me, the same one who lived here a year ago and we talked a lot. I am moving yesterday's plans for today 😅.

03/09/2020
---
Yesterday I managed to write most of the article on my blog. Additionally, yesterday my promoter sent comments to my thesis and I have already corrected most of those comments - there are still a few left. During the day, nothing interesting happened yesterday, I did not have any physical activity or anything 😒. Today I want to go out on a bike + finish the article on the blog.

04/09/2020
---
Ekhmm... yesterday outside of work I only managed to ride a bike. I didn't finish writing an article on my blog and correcting my thesis. Reason? I was at the evening service in the church 😏. So once again I am postponing yesterday's plans for today 😅.

05/09/2020
---
A nice day yesterday was 🙃. I managed to finish the article on my blog + I drove over 40 km by bike 🚴 and by the way I visited my grandparents in the village 🙂. Everything is calm at work, too - lately, thank God, work has fallen to a further priority in my life. The plan for today is to make all the improvements in my thesis and enjoy the day - especially since my cousin from Germany came today.

06/09/2020
---
It was good Saturday 👍! I corrected most of my thesis (I only have minor remarks left from the promoter), met with my cousin and we went together to the pool 🙂. In the evening my cousin came to me, we made burgers and talked about God 🤗! Aaa... and still in the morning (around 11 am so I don't know if it's such a morning 😅) I was on a bike. This is what I call a good day 👊! And today's plan is as standard as on Sunday - rest, visit, enjoy life 😉😉.

07/09/2020
---
Beautiful Sunday 🤗. After the morning service I ate a light dinner at home and then went for a barbecue to my cousins. There was a handful of friends and we could spend time together. In the evening I went to the second service and after that I started writing on a messenger with a girl who I think I love 🤫. The plan for today is to visit my friend and run or ride a bicycle together and additionally make corrections to my thesis 🙂.

08/09/2020
---
Yesterday I met with my friend after about 3 weeks! We went out on bikes together and talked a lot 🙂🙂. I also managed to make corrections to my thesis - although not everything is perfect, but frankly speaking I have other priorities. Today I would like to start writing an article for my blog but what's also important, I'm planning to visit my friend again only this time his whole family in his apartment 😛.

09/09/2020
---
Yesterday I did not manage to write an article on my blog but I visited my friend and his family 😍😇. We had a nice time, we talked about various topics. Today I would like to start writing this article but we will see what this day brings... Surely, if the weather will be quite nice, I want to go out on a bike 👍💪.

10/09/2020
---
Yesterday it was nice weather and I went cycling - I did 40 km 🚴💪. The weather was so nice that in the late afternoon (evening) I decided to offer my friend a walk and that's how we spent the evening - talking and walking 🙃. Of course for this reason I didn't have enough time for a blog article, but it's okay - these are important and more important things. Today I will deal with the article 😛.

11/09/2020
---
The next day passed and I still haven't started to write an article on the blog 🙄🙄. I always have an excuse, e.g. yesterday I had a lot of work to do, then I had to and wanted to run away, then I went to the evening service and when I started writing an article I started an interesting discussion on God's matters with my roommate 😅. Maybe tonight will be a good day, although it may be hard because I want to go out on a bike, and what the evening will bring is unknown 😀.

12/09/2020
---
Yesterday there was a lot going on 😮. First of all, we had a lot of problems at work, all week long. There were so many problems that I said right away - Friday after 3 pm I am unavailable! And that's how it was, right after work I went on a bike and did 40 km to get some good stress off 😄. Later a friend of mine spoke to me if I wanted to go for a run and well... I didn't refuse - so we ran 5.5 km 😝. After the run I went to him and ate some unhealthy food + I talked to him and his wife 🙂.At the end of the day I still managed to write an article on the blog - I was totally surprised because I kept postponing it and as it turned out it was enough to start properly! Cool 👍!

13/09/2020
---
It was a well spent Saturday 👍. I read a lot, I was with my friend on bicycles and in the evening our cousins came to my brother and sister-in-law so we could have a good time 😍. It is Sunday today and as usual on Sunday I have no plans, although I would like to cycle because last night I ate a lot of junk food 😋.

14/09/2020
---
Beautiful Sunday - sunny and joyful 😍. In the morning I was at the service, then I went out on a bike and spent the evening with the youth from the neighboring church - we played volleyball and talked till very late. It will be warm and sunny again for the next three days 😍😎! I want to use it as soon as possible 🤗. So the plan for today is to go out on a bike 🚴🚴.

15/09/2020
---
I was able to execute yesterday's plan in 100%. I was on a bike and spent the evening with friends 🤗🤗. At first we played volleyball and then we went to a friend's house and there we talked and had a nice time 👍. Today is also expected to be nice weather so I want to use this day as much as possible 🙃.

16/09/2020
---
I think that again yesterday was a good day - I was on a bike and did over 40 km 🚴. Besides, I was preparing documents for my thesis because soon I will have to defend myself - thank God for giving me the strength to write it 🙏. Since today is the last beautiful and sunny day, I would also like to go out on a bike 😎. Additionally, I have to bind my thesis and print out all required documents. It would also be nice to start writing an article on the blog 🙂.

17/09/2020
---
Yesterday I managed to do almost everything except the article on the blog 🤫... And the cover of my thesis didn't quite work out either (I framed it but it has to be fixed) and today I will have to go again and do it. Today I am additionally going to Bialystok to pass all the documents concerning my thesis. And I have no plans for today - I have a fast day and I want it to be a day dedicated to God 🙏.

18/09/2020
---
Yesterday I managed to deal with all the documents in Bialystok and, thank God, I spent all day in the fast 🙂.Yesterday I also had online training at work, so I could afford a lighter day. Today I have to go back to work and write an article on my blog - this is my plan for today 👍.

19/09/2020
---
The plan has been executed in 100% 🤗! I managed to write an article on my blog and even found time to ride a bike - this year I did almost 2000 kilometers 😲, and that's not the end of the year 💪💪. The plan for today is to finish reading the article about transactions in Java and in the evening to go to a youth meeting, which will be held in the village 🙂.

20/09/2020
---
As for yesterday, I had no exorbitant plans and of course I managed to make them 😛. But apart from that, I did some other - in my opinion - important things: I cleaned the room, ran 10 km with my friend and helped my mother to make apple jam (I peeled apples). In the evening we had a nice time with the youth and that's how Saturday passed 🙂. Today is Sunday and my plans are to be at both services (in the evening I serve).

21/09/2020
---
Ohh... what a beautiful Sunday it was 😍. Especially in spiritual terms - it can be seen that God listened to my Thursday's post 😇😇. And today you have to go back to everyday life 😝. The plan for today is to go out on a bike and start writing an article on the blog (and the coolest thing would be to write the whole article).

22/09/2020
---
Yesterday I succeeded only in part of the plan - the one related to the bike 😅. But with what style - we went on a bike in 3 - me and two friends. And that was a well spent time 🙂. In the evening I went to a friend's place and we played a board game. Today the plan is the same as yesterday - this time only, I want to spend the evening more peacefully 😛.

23/09/2020
---
This time yesterday's plan went more successful than last time 🤣. I did not write the whole article on the blog, but one paragraph yes. Today I want to enjoy the weather again and go cycling. Additionally, today is my sister-in-law's birthday, yesterday I made a cake so tonight we will celebrate 😍✨.

24/09/2020
---
Yesterday I had another successful day. I wrote another section of the article, drove 40 km by bike and in the evening we spent time with family celebrating my sister-in-law's birthday 🙂. And again, the plan for today will be similar to that of yesterday 😅 - a bicycle, an article on the blog and in the evening I want to go to the service. I enjoy the weather 100% as long as it is 😎🤗!

25/09/2020
---
Yesterday's plan was fulfilled in 100% 🙃! I cycled 40 km by bike, wrote the whole article on the blog and spent a good time with my family in the evening. We sat and talked about God's themes with my brother, his wife and our parents 👍. And what about today? I would like to prepare a presentation to defend my thesis - a large part of it I already have taken from an earlier diploma seminar 😅. Additionally, it would be nice to prepare 3 questions for the exam.

26/09/2020
---
And once again, yesterday's plan is 100% done 🤗. It turned out that I have all the questions for the diploma exam as well - I just have to learn it (30 pdf pages 🤔). Yesterday I found out that my cousin had a car accident and I visited him twice - once in the morning and once in the evening 😋 - he has a broken shoulder but thank God he is alive. All right - let's get back to our plans for today. I would like to prepare another 7 questions to defend my thesis. As a preparation I mean to rewrite it on a piece of paper and learn something there 😆. Additionally, it would be nice to go out on a bicycle and ride 20-30 km 🚴🚴. 

27/09/2020
---
Yesterday's day went according to the plan 🙃. I cycled 30 km but it was very hard - there was a huge wind and it was hard to ride 😧 but I made it 💪. In the evening I was also at a special service in the church next door - in Dubicze - there was a pastor who goes to India and helps. He talked about the mission + said a preaching. Today is Sunday - Lord's day, the day of rest. I am planning to go to the neighboring church on agappe after the morning service 🙂.

28/09/2020
---
Although yesterday the weather wasn't good, it was a beautiful day 🤗! From morning to evening something was happening. After the morning service - as I planned - I went to the neighboring church on agappe. We had a very good time 👏👏! Today I decided to fast and on this day I am not setting up any special activities either. We will see what this day brings 🙂. 

29/09/2020
---
Yesterday I spent my day fasting and it was a good day 🙃. Today I will finally eat something 🤗 (I already ate a pancake in the morning 😆).Today's goal is to prepare a sketch of an article for a blog about what I will want to write about + preparation for a presentation to defend my thesis. 

30/09/2020
---
Another great day 😍! Apart from the fact that I managed to do everything I planned to do yesterday, I also went out with my friends to the pool in the evening and then we went to the church in Dubicze to eat waffles 😁. We sat with young people and talked late on various topics.

01/10/2020
---
I didn't even realize that I hadn't set myself any goal for yesterday. Nevertheless, I managed somehow without it 😝. I learned to defend my thesis + practiced the presentation. As for yesterday, it was very boring and gloomy. And I had such a humor too - I don't know why... Today, however, I will set myself a goal - to finish the article on the blog and I hope that my mood will be better than yesterday 🙂.

02/10/2020
---
Thank God! Both things I planned yesterday are done 🤗! Great 😇. Last night we could have a prayer with some friends and it was a good time. Today's plan is to learn questions to defend my thesis + additionally as a physical activity I want to walk in the forest 👍. 

03/10/2020
---
Yesterday's day was funny. After work I went to visit my cousin and spent 2-3 hours there talking to my cousins, aunt and uncle 🙃. Coming home (I took my cousin with me) something happened to my car and I will have to take it to the mechanic 😭😭. But the evening was still pleasant because my cousin and her husband came by, we sat in the evening, ate pizza and talked 👍.

04/10/2020
---
Another great day 👍! We celebrated the wedding anniversary of my uncle and aunt - I ate far too much cake 😅😅. The last days are very uncontrollable when it comes to eating 🙄. And today is Sunday and I have no idea what will happen - I know I want to run 4 km today 🏃.  

05/10/2020
---
It was an unusual sports Sunday 😝. In the morning I ran 5 km and in the afternoon I cycled 30 km 💪💪. We had a harvest festival in the church and after the morning service there was cake and time together (I ate a lot of cake and that's why I had to go out on a bike 🤣🤣). Today we start the week and it's nice as if I managed to write an article on the blog - or at least a large part of it.

06/10/2020
---
Yesterday I did not manage to write a post on my blog 🙄🙄. But I have a very good excuse - I spent the evening with a friend - we talked, walked and ate 😆. Generally it was a good evening, although I lacked a little bit of courage to say what lies in my heart. Today I'm going to do yesterday's plan - write a post on the blog 🙂.

07/10/2020
---
I did not manage to 100% realize yesterday's plan (again I have a good excuse 😅). I wrote about 60% of the article and I didn't manage to do it all because in the afternoon/evening I was at a friend's place and helped him install the cabinets.I don't know about such things and I was just a helper 😝 (but thanks to such help I am learning something new). Today I want to finish the article on my blog in 100% 🙂👍.

08/10/2020
---
Finally - yesterday's plan has been made and the article on the blog is now ready 👍. Yesterday, my friend and I ran over 7 km at a pretty good (for him) pace 🏃. Today I want to learn the questions for the defense exam 😏. Honestly, I don't want to but I know that I have to 🤣🤣.

09/10/2020
---
Yesterday's day was good 👍. Thank God I have a lot of calm at work recently 😇. I just have to learn how to use it better. Today I took a day off at work and want to use it well 🙂. I will certainly learn to defend my thesis, but I also want to help my parents in the backyard, clean the house and such smaller things 💪.

10/10/2020
---
It seems to me that I made good use of yesterday's 👍. I helped my parents, cleaned up, visited my cousin and studied 🙂. I just checked that I had a day to defend my thesis on October 19th, so I will have to spend the whole week learning 😝.

11/10/2020
---
Yesterday I spent most of the day at home and felt terrible in my mentality. Fortunately, my cousin called me in the evening and took me out to a youth meeting, where we had a good time with God! 🙂🙂 Today is Sunday and as a standard - no plans for today 👍.

12/10/2020
---
It was a good Sunday 🤗! Thank God I could be at the both services. I had a delicious dinner with my parents, visited my cousins as well as my uncle and aunt - and we had an interesting discussion. And in the evening - at the end of the day - my friend and cousin came to me and we watched the Polish football match together 🙂. Today we start a new week and the plan is simple - prepare for the diploma exam!

13/10/2020
---
Yesterday I had a lazy day and I didn't want to do anything 🤫😧. I ran 4 km, visited my cousin and ate a homemade tortilla and in the evening I went to the pool with a friend. However, from the category of work / study, I did not want to do anything. Today I don't make any plans but I just want to act and not waste my time 👍.

14/10/2020
---
It was another difficult day in terms of my productivity. I learned a little bit, but in general I'm completely reluctant 😓😓. Last night I additionally went with my friends to the pool 🏊. Today I am fasting and this is what I am focusing on 🙂. 

15/10/2020
---
I've been sitting for 5 minutes and can't even squeeze a sentence. Recently I have had some more difficult days - lack of motivation and willingness. The most important thing in all this is to serve God with all my heart and God will somehow arrange everything.

16/10/2020
---
And new restrictions begin...😤😡. I don't like it, and I think that hardly anyone likes it but we have to live with it. Today I took a day off from work and am going to study to defend my thesis, which I have on Monday.

17/10/2020
---
Yesterday was a good day 🙂. I learned a lot and in the evening we went with friends to the pool. I was there for over 2 hours and I used the maximum because from now on all swimming pools are closed 😡! Today I am continuing my studies and I am going to enjoy life 😋.

18/10/2020
---
Yesterday I watched the competition in a league of legends game. Although I don't play anymore, I like to watch such things. I also repeated the set of questions for the exam. Today I will repeat all the questions once again and tomorrow I will check myself in action 😅. Yesterday evening I also visited my friend, his wife and daughter - we had a good time, we talked 🙂.

19/10/2020
---
Yesterday nothing interesting happened in my life. I attended both services and also repeated the material to defend my thesis. In the evening I got a skin complaint and started to have a strange itching - I feel it is caused by subconscious stress... The plan for today is to pass the exam and get a master's degree. 

20/10/2020
---
Thank God I made it! Since yesterday, I have a Master's degree 👨🎓😆. Today I return to work after a 2-day leave. I'm just afraid that my rash, which keeps bothering me, will be a big problem 😭😭.

21/10/2020
---
I'll be honest - I've been in a bad mood for a week because the girl I think I fell in love with is not interested in me. It hurts a bit. I try to live a normal life but I feel and I know that I will have to talk to her seriously, so that this matter can be 100% explained. It will certainly not happen today or tomorrow, but maybe in the next few days. For this moment I have to put on a mask and pretend that everything is fine.

22/10/2020
---
Yesterday I ran with my friend :) It's good to break away mentally from what's deep inside a person. Today I am fasting.

23/10/2020
---
Yesterday, contrary to appearances, I had a good day 🙂🙂. I didn't manage to fast all day long - I only lasted until 3 pm. But what I noticed is that it's nice not to eat most of the time and then eat what you want 😆. Today I took a day off at work. I am going to write a blog post and maybe write a list of ideas what to do next in life.

24/10/2020
---
Yesterday I managed to finish my blog post and today it would be good to write a part of the next one because next week will be busy. Yesterday I sat with my cousins until late evening (almost midnight) and watched my nephew 😝. Today, apart from writing the blog post, I will be watching the semi-finals of the league of legends 😁.

25/10/2020
---
Yesterday I spent the whole day at home 🙄. In the evening my cousins came to me so we spent time together talking and eating the cake I made 😅. Today is Sunday and that usually means that I don't plan in advance what I should do today - although last week I guess I didn't plan at all 🤫.

26/10/2020
---
I really liked this Sunday 👍! Although I didn't visit friends even though I had an invitation, I was at two meetings. Besides, I took a walk in the forest (over 8 km) and felt that it was a very productive Sunday 🙃. Today, I have time off at work and my goal is simple - to finish the article on the blog! 💪  

27/10/2020
---
I managed to do yesterday's plan in 100% - the article is finished and ready to be published 👍. Additionally, yesterday I decided that I will speak to a friend and talk frankly whether there will be anything between us or not. We did so and talked for almost 2 hours. Finally, she is supposed to think about it and give me an answer in some time - I pray that it will be according to God's will 🙂. Today I come back to work after 2 days off 😛. The plan for today is to reorganize the room a bit (at least start 😅).

28/10/2020
---
Yesterday's plan was fulfilled - I cleaned my room, thus preparing it for a small reorganization 😄. Apart from that, in the evening, I ran into some friends and we spent a very nice time together talking about various topics 🙂. Today I want to finally prepare my room for the changes.

29/10/2020
---
And once again I managed to carry out the assumed plan 🤗. Now I'm just waiting for a new desk to come and I will be able to 100% finish refreshing the room 😛. The plan for today is simple - take care of all the paperwork at work (today is my last 100% working day).

30/10/2020
---
Finally, I failed to complete yesterday's plan 😅👎. Of course I have a good excuse. Yesterday a laptop from a new company came to me and I had to configure everything. Anyway... most of the stuff I've managed to figure out anyway, I only have 1 paper left to print 😛. Today I have no plans, I have to go to Bialystok and finish all work connected with work 🙃.

Yesterday I managed to deal with all things related to the last day of work in Bialystok. I had nice talks with my boss and the girls from HR. I spent the evening with my friends - we played some board game and talked a lot 🙂.

01/11/2020

Yesterday I spent all day at home 🥱. Admittedly, in the afternoon my cousin's husband came to me and we talked for almost 4 hours so this time was not wasted. Additionally we installed linux on my old computer 😝. Today is Sunday and it is my dad's birthday 🥳.

02/11/2020
---
Yesterday, thank God I could be at two services 🙂. In addition, we celebrated my dad's birthday with our family 🥳🥳! It was a good time and a nice Sunday 🤗.

03/11/2020

I didn't even notice that yesterday I didn't set any target for the day 😮. Or maybe that's good? Recently I've been wondering a lot about whether I'm restricting my freedom 🤔. Today I'm supposed to receive a new desk so I'll probably assemble it and this is my goal for the day 😅.

04/11/2020
---
Yesterday's plan was successfully completed although it was not easy 😄. The desk didn't come until 3 p.m. and I had a lot of problems with its assembly 😅😅. But the final result is that today's note is written on this desk in a standing position 👍. The plan for today is to read two articles from my todo list, finish the blog post and take a ride for at least 30 minutes by bicycle, which is in the basement (or run with a friend).

05/11/2020
---
Yesterday's day was both intense and successful 🙃! I have been able to realize all yesterday's plans. Yesterday nothing interesting happened in my life - I spent all day at home. Today I plan to read one article from the weekly list and again ride a bicycle for 30 minutes.

06/11/2020
---
Again, I managed to carry out the plan I assumed for yesterday's 👍. It wasn't demanding, but if I was lying, I wouldn't have made it 😆. Yesterday I also introduced myself briefly to the whole company - which was a bit stressful 😛. Tonight we have an online team integration 😄. Today the plan is the same as yesterday - read the article from the list and 30 minutes by bike.

07/11/2020
---
Once again, I managed to complete the task 🤗 - although this time it was harder because I was not motivated to bike. Yesterday we additionally had a team integration, which started at 6pm and ended around 9:30pm. Everyone introduced themselves and talked about themselves (their hobbies) for a few minutes. There were about 10 of us and it took some time 🙄. Today the plan I set myself is to take an hour walk 🦶 and then enjoy the day 👊.

08/11/2020
---
It will be boring if I write that once again I managed to carry out the assumed plan, but it happened 😆. It was not demanding but the plan was 😛. In the evening I went to the youth meeting in the church next door. We had a good time. We could listen to advice about couples and dating 🤫.

09/11/2020
---
Yesterday, although I had a very productive day, I did not feel fulfilled. I missed some contact with my friends to go out or something. Instead I spent the whole day at home. Although I was at the service and after lunch I went for a walk, but that is not it. Today we start the new week 💪. To be honest, I have no plans for today. May God guide me 😇.

10/11/2020
---
Yesterday's day was boring 😶, although to make it a bit more interesting I went for a run and ran 4 km 😛. Today I decided to fast all day long - I have a case I want it to be heard. Therefore, today again I have no plans 🙂. 

11/11/2020
---
Thank God I could stand in the post, although I won't say, it wasn't easy 😛. Today is a national holiday and therefore I do not work today 🙂. The plan for today is to read the last article from the todo list, go run around and start writing another article for next week 👍.

12/11/2020
---
Yesterday was a nice day 👍. Yesterday's plan was theoretically realized, but in practice, writing the article didn't work out as I planned - from 3 pm I was not at home until the end of the day 😝. At first, my cousin and I went to a friend's house for waffles and there were a few people there so we stayed and talked until almost 8 pm. And then we came back to me and there were friends at my brother's and his wife's house, so we also went and talked 😆. Today I will be introducing myself to a new project 💪💪!

13/11/2020
---
Yesterday I had an introduction and discussion of the project to which I join 👍. I met the team and also introduced myself 😛. After work I was at an evening service and later I met a friend and we had a serious conversation. Actually, nothing concrete came out of this conversation, but I think we needed it. Today I would like to move on with writing an article on my blog.

14/11/2020
---
Finally, I did not accomplish my intended plan 😅😅. Yesterday after work I turned off my computer and did not use it until the end of 🙂. Today I have the whole Saturday free so I would like to write this article and additionally I am planning to run through 🏃🏃.

15/11/2020
---
Yesterday's plan failed again. Yes, I managed to run out, but I did not manage to write an article on the blog 😢. However, I think that this Saturday was a very good one anyway. I threw away some old things with my mom, cleaned my room and after 3 pm I was visiting friends 😅😅. Today, as usual on Sunday, I have no plans - I will enjoy life! 🤗

16/11/2020
---
A very nice Sunday went out 🤗. I could be at two services, for the evening I went together with my female cousin and a friend, who will now live with me for a week 👍. In the evening, after the service, my brother and my cousin came to me and together we watched the Polish football match 😝. Today is the beginning of the new week and I want to change the formula of these daily posts again - I won't always write what are my plans for today, because I don't always want to implement them 😆😆.

17/11/2020
---
Yesterday after work I had interesting conversations with my colleague, who now lives with me for a week. We talked about various topics but mainly related to faith and God 🙂.

18/11/2020
---
Yesterday I managed to do a few things - I finished the article on the blog, set the publication of all the articles for the blog challenge and cycled in the basement. Only with the latter there is such a problem that my knee aches after it and I don't know if I will not have to give it up 🤔.

19/11/2020
---
Time flies by very quickly 😶. I've recently noticed such a sinusoidal of moods, once I feel good and happy and another time not really 🙄. An interesting observation 😝.

20/11/2020
---
Thank God for yesterday's 🙏. I bought myself a new phone (I thought yesterday was a black Friday 😅). It is a bit connected with my plans to start vlogging from next year, but we will see how it goes. Besides, yesterday I ran 5 km and later I did a walk on the tracks at a beautiful sunset 🤗🤗.

21/11/2020
---
Thank God yesterday I managed to fast all day long 🙏 . I must admit that the fast was poor quality because a new phone came to me and I spent a lot of time configuring it. By the way, these new phones need permissions for everything 🤔🤔.

22/11/2020
---
Yesterday I actually spent all day without a computer 👍. In the morning I went to Bialystok to get my master's diploma, then - when I came back - I took a 2-hour walk, ate dinner, talked to my parents and a colleague, who now lives with me and only in the evening sat down to the computer 😝. It was good Saturday 👌!

23/11/2020
---
Cool Sunday - quiet and peaceful 🙂. I was at both services, took a 5 km walk and spent a good time with my family 🤗🤗. 

24/11/2020
---
Finally, my laptop came from a client and I can start programming 🤣! Yesterday I spent the whole day at home and I do not have much to say 😝. The last days are very quiet in my life 👍.

25/11/2020
---
Yesterday, not much happened again. I said goodbye to my short-term roommate, who lived with me for a week because he has already returned to his home 😛. But today the second roommate is coming, so I don't have time for boredom 😅. Today I also start blogging challenge. Actually, I started it 2 days earlier because I prefer to have the materials in advance if something urgent happens.

26/11/2020
---
Yesterday I had a very good day 🤗! It was mainly due to the fact that I was writing with my friend, who I like more than others 🤫. Besides, I was approached by a boss from one of the previous companies for which I was a subcontractor and we will probably negotiate a job with them.

27/11/2020
---
Once again, I had a very good day 👍! Thank God for his blessing! I could be at the evening service and then my cousin visited me and we talked together with my brother, his wife and our parents 🙂.

28/11/2020
---
Friday, like every last day, went by very quickly. In the evening I was at a prayer meeting in the church and then I spent the evening with friends. We sat and talked about various things 😝. Today is Saturday and just today I have a few plans that I would like to realize, so I will write them: run at least 5 km, finish the todo list for this week, move the domain to another service, write 2-3 articles to blogging challenge 💪.

29/11/2020
---
I managed to realize the whole yesterday's plan 🤗👍. I had a very big sleeping problem today... Once I couldn't fall asleep because my nephew, who was crying downstairs, kept waking me up, and twice - I woke up several times at night. Even now it is 5:45 a.m. and my alarm clock will ring in 15 minutes. Okay, as far as today is concerned, it's Sunday and as a standard, I don't plan anything except to visit my aunt who has a birthday 🥳🥳!

30/11/2020
---
It was one of the best Sundays this year 💪☺️. I was at both services, then with the whole family we were at my aunt's birthday party and in the evening I went to spend time with the youth from the neighboring church, where we also had a good time and talked until late 👍🙃.

01/12/2020
---
Yesterday's day was very busy 😶. At least that was my feeling. Yesterday I ordered a delivery man to pick up the phone from me because I'm returning it and I want it to be exchanged for another. The one I have has some defect related to the location 😓. I also visited my cousin, who bought himself a new laptop 😝.

02/12/2020
---
Yesterday I did not even leave home 😶. The day wasn't wasted, but I felt a little lack of movement, so in the evening I made a 30-minute session on the cross trainer in the basement. At work I finally got access to everything, so today I will be able to start configuring the environment 👍.

03/12/2020
---
Hmm... yesterday was ok, without any revelation. Today I decided to fast 🙂. Today I would also like to go to the forest or something because I have not had much movement since Sunday.

04/12/2020
---
Yesterday's day was not one of the easiest 😑. The very fact of fasting and lack of food during the day is tiring. Additionally, I have a new job offer, which I am seriously considering and I will probably make a final decision at the weekend.

05/12/2020
---
Finally the weekend! And yesterday I also had a good day 😁! I have a lot to think about lately... I'm thinking about the job offer I got, and I'll also tell you that for the last few days I've been thinking very seriously whether to propose to my friend 😝. 

06/12/2020
---
Yesterday's day was completely unproductive, but it's okay because I did everything during the week 😛. Yesterday afternoon I visited my cousin and later in the evening we went to a youth meeting and stayed there until very late (almost till 11pm). It was a well spent Saturday 🙂👍!

07/12/2020
---
Yesterday's Sunday was one of the best days this year 👍🤗! I was at both services, at my aunt's birthday party and in the evening we had another meeting with the youth from the neighboring church! This time we sat almost until midnight 😲😆 - we talked on different topics and I think it was a good time 🙃.

08/12/2020
---
It was a good Monday. I didn't have a pair to program today so I could make a calmer day 👍 and so I did 😆😆. The last days are very good for me and thank God for that! 🙂

09/12/2020
---
Somehow yesterday I didn't feel that it was a good day... It wasn't bad, but I didn't do anything special, so I felt poorly 🤔. Yesterday I had a final conversation with another company and it will turn out whether or not I will change the client 🙄.

10/12/2020
---
Yesterday's day was ok - it wasn't too good, but it wasn't bad either. Today I will be fasting. We will see how I will feel 😝. Although for me the most important thing in fasting is the intention with which I am going to fast 🙏. By the way, from the new year I intend to switch to Polish in these daily notes.

11/12/2020
---
Yesterday, despite the fast, I had a great feeling and a lot of strength 😮🤗. Thank God for that 😇! Yesterday I also got a final job offer with details and I will probably accept it - now I'm just waiting for the contract draft 😏. Today I had a strange night... I woke up a lot and finally I got up over an hour before the alarm clock (which was at 5:30 in the morning). 

12/12/2020
---
We have a cool date today 😛. As for yesterday, thank God the day was well spent. Actually, not much was going on, but it was good as well. Last few weeks I've been making my whole weekly plan during the week and the weekend is free. And I like that! It does not mean that I spend Saturday doing nothing. On the contrary - thanks to the lack of obligation I feel that I am more creative 🙃!

13/12/2020
---
It was good Saturday 👍👍! In the afternoon I ate a delicious dinner prepared by my mother 🤗 and spent the evening at my friend's. There were other friends, we had a nice time 🙃.

14/12/2020
---
And thank God for another beautiful day in life ❤️! It was a good Sunday. After the morning service I went for a walk and after coming back my back started to hurt... It's possible that I blew my back but it is not a big deal. I will have even more to thank for when they stop hurting 😆😆. Today I start the new week! I am in good spirits and may it be according to God's will!

15/12/2020
---
I don't know if it was a good Monday or not 😆. It wasn't bad - that's for sure! I'm waiting for the contract from the new company so that I can get to know it... If they don't send it to me by Thursday, I'll call them and ask them to do it. Apart from that - now, I don't feel well in this new company. The project I am on is very strange. I have the impression that there is nothing to do here 🤔🤔.

16/12/2020
---
I have 3 things to describe and immortalize. The first one - I talked to my cousin about the proposals (because my candidate is her friend) and she gave me a lot of encouragement + interesting ideas. Two - I have a little turbulence at work now, they want to change my project and I will have to work in strange hours... Today I will have to call and urge the other company to send me a contract. Three - because of all this I slept very poorly tonight and I feel that I have raised my emotions 😄.

17/12/2020
---
Yesterday, as I said, I reminded the company of the contract... And indeed, the HR lady forgot to send me an email with the contract 😅. Now it's all done! Yesterday, I also told a friend and his wife about my engagement plans. Tough days are coming up to my life 😝.

18/12/2020
---
This week is going by stubbornly in the context of writing blog posts. Fortunately, the blog challenge is already ending 👍. The whole situation regarding the engagement confuses me a lot - especially in my head 😝.

19/12/2020
---
Yesterday I had a good day 🙂! I was fasting, but I felt very good physically and much better spiritually! Today at 12 o'clock I plan to eat a meal and thank God for helping me fast. Yesterday I could also be at prayer in the evening: first at my church and then together with my cousin and aunt in the neighboring church 💪💪.

20/12/2020
---
Yesterday we had a good time together with the youth 👍🙃. I came home after midnight and now I'm trying to get over yesterday's 😅.
