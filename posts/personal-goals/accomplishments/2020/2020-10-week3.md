### Week in Review
It was one of the worse weeks 😕. I felt bad all week long - in terms of productivity, but also physically, it wasn't the best. Recently I have been missing a project I could get involved in - I have more and more free time that I waste on youtube or other stupid things. This must stop! I am able to meet my weekly goals... but they are not too challenging 🤔. As you can see I have some things to improve. We will see in time what will come out of it 🙃.
