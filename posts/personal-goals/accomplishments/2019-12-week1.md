### Week in Review
This week started stressfully. I taught classes on Tuesday and had to prepare myself properly - I did it the second time so the stress was still there. After that I felt much better - like more freedom 😂? I don't know what the feeling was but I know for a fact that the experience I gained during the classes is priceless 👍. The second part of the week was very ordinary - I worked a lot + I did projects for studies and learned ✏️.
