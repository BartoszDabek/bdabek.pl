First day of new year. To be honest nothing special happened today. I wrote short summary of 2018, went on swimming pool and that's all.

02/01/2019
---
Today I did a workout üí™üí™ and went to the swimming pool üèä. I was so focused on my work (I don't have any tasks because all people are on vacation), but I still finished working around 10 pm :D. I know it's a bit sick, but I felt so good and didn't feel the passing of time. 

03/01/2019
---
What a day!! First I installed something new to work which took 10 hours and then I went on swimming pool and swam 2x50meters under the water! We had a really great team yesterday on the pool, I guess that's the reason!

04/01/2019
---
Today I was writing the documentation for the code I'm taking over. I also refactorized this code to make it  look more redable. Ofc I was also at the swimming pool (I'm there everyday for 2 weeks). My supervisor sent me a review of my engineering work, so I also corrected it.

05/01/2019
---
5th day of 2019 officialy ended. Today I coocked a really tasty meal! Chicken with rice (sounds normal, but it was SUPER good). Tomorrow I'll add some vegetables (especially broccoli) to this. I like cooking! üî™üëç

06/01/2019
---
I forgot about this completely! It's a day after and I realized I didn't write anything here. Shame on me!

07/01/2019
---
Totday was 1st real work day in this year. We had a meeting with summary of what is left to do. I was also celebrating 2nd Christmas (Orthodox) with family. Here, where I live, we're celebrating everything :D.

08/01/2019
---
First day in the office in this year. I've not been in the office since almost 3 weeks! It's good to be back in here :)

09/01/2019
---
It was a good day. In work all is on a good road. The only thing I missing is knowledge :D. I need to learn more and learn harder to be a better developer!!

10/01/2019
---
Today after back from work I ate dinner and with roommates we started cleaning our flat. It took us almost 3 hours to clean it all. I feel proud of us because we were planning that since few months but noone wasn't to take an action and today - we all took!

11/01/2019
---
Today 2 of my friends came to our flat. They have studies this weekend and that's the reason why. It was a fun evening :).

12/01/2019
---
I had my thesis presentation on seminar at studies. It is always kind of stressfull when I have to present something in front of a people. But I did it and the result is that I have to prepare better and cut the duration. 

13/01/2019
---
Sunday. I ate dinner with my family at my parents. It is always good to spend time with your family. I love them and it is really important for everyone to respect family and find time for them!

14/01/2019
---
Our production server was down the whole day. I had a time to learn something new and to focus a little bit on my stuff.

15/01/2019
---
It was a pretty tough day! I got off from work a little bit earlier because I had to do some papers to school. But after returning to home I had few emails about new tasks. Beside of that I had to make some project on studies with my colleague. A lot of things to do and the day is only 24h :D.

16/01/2019
---
Studying, studying, studying... Lately there is a lot of this. My day very often looks like this: work > dinner after work > workout > studying. But to be honest, I like to study :)

17/01/2019
---
Today in work we had a meeting about future and the current state of our project. In the end of the March we'll have a final decision if project go further or fails. Beside of that it was a good day! üëçüëç

18/01/2019
---
I had awesome day! And honestly, I don't know why... I had the feeling of coming spring and I LOVE it. I really want it to be spring now! Today I also came back to my hometown for a weekend :)

19/01/2019
---
I slept 10 hours and I don't feel bad about it. I know that my body sometimes needs a longer rest and if I can do it, I do it.

20/01/2019
---
Today after dinner I came back to Bialystok (the place where I work). To be honest, I don't know how long I'll stay here (I mean in the flat I currently living) because my roommate is moving out and we had a good relationships.

21/01/2019
---
Today I got offer from one of my colleagues on current project to join the another project he works on. I think I'll take it. I talk to my boss and he said it's ok for him. I'll probably know more details tomorrow.

22/01/2019
---
I felt really terrible today. I had a headache and couldn't focus on things I had to do. I went sleep at 9 pm... ;)

23/01/2019
---
That was a good day. I finally settled matters with my diploma thesis. I gave it to the dean's office. In work we're configuring cluster environment so I have to figure out how to deploy on it. That's interesting and challenging (I have never worked with cluster systems before).

24/01/2019
---
I finally finished one of my critical tasks today! The one drawback on this is that I can't test it until install on production. I see how (unit) tests gives a hidden power of not beeing afraid of modyfing etc. Sometimes I even feel guilty when I write a code and didn't write tests to it :D.

25/01/2019
---
I finally took a decision about new project. I'm on board. From the next week I'm starting to work on second project (the same client). I took it only for one reason: experience.

26/01/2019
---
Today was the last day of my studies. I think I have successfully completed my education (at least bachelor). I have to defend my diploma thesis and officially I'll be an engineer!

27/01/2019
---
It was a pleasant Sunday. At the morning I've been at the church then afterwords I went on swimming pool. I relaxed myself and had conversation with a friend who's the lifeguard there.

28/01/2019
---
Monday.. I woke up at 5am, breakfast, work, workout, learning and sleep. In short it was all day. It was good. I think that at the end of the week I'll take some remote work so that I can concentrate more on learning to defend my diploma thesis.

29/01/2019
---
Lately I have terrible headaches while intense work. I hope it isn't anything serious. I'll work tomorrow with the pomodoro technique to see results.

30/01/2019
---
What a crazy day! I have some critical bug reports in our system and I don't know what causes it... Additionally I have to learn a lot to my diploma exam. One more news, I'll probably have to move out of the flat I'm currently renting 'cause my roommates are moving out.

31/01/2019
---
I was at the jsession today which is a group of the java developers. There was 2 talks. First about functional programming in Scala and the second one about profiling the applications. In my opinion the second one was better. It was presented by a deaveloper with 12 years experience that was talking on his life experience with profiling. 

01/02/2019
---
Friiiiday!! Start of the weekend :)! I was at the swimming pool with a couple of colleagues. It was a good time and I could relax. Besides, I have a lot of learning to my diploma exam. 

02/02/2019
---
Today I've been a procrastinating. I learned something for my diploma exam, but I know I could have done more. Anyway, rest is also very important so balance is the best option.

03/02/2019
---
What a laaazy Sunday. Buy, I wish we'll have a spring/summer right now. I just want to go outside, take off a shirt and get a sun!!

04/02/2019
---
And the Monday. Everything was good at work. When I got home I ate a dinner, which I took from home :D and I did a training. Then I studied to diploma exam and repeated my presentation. I have to present it 2 min faster (today it was 11 min).

05/02/2019
---
It's getting closer and closer to the final day of thesis exam. It's on Thursday. I think I'm ready to that. I've been learning a lot in last and current week. We'll see the result :)

06/02/2019
---
Work and study. This words describe my last days clearly. Tomorrow is a day of truth - will I be an engineer? Tomorrow I'll know that.

07/02/2019
---
I have it! 5 on my diploma exam :) and I'm super happy :D. From tomorrow I'm starting my first 25 days challenge - breath holding. It will last unti 5 of March and I'll update my best 'score' every week in readme file (just to see potential progress).

08/02/2019
---
I went on volleyball training and after warmup I decided it's not for me. I suck. I wasn't playing for 2 months and I literally suck. So after warmup I took my stuff and went on swimming pool which is next to the place where we had a training.

09/02/2019

That was a good day. I've been so productive. First I finished exercises for chapter 7 of git course. Afterwards I created a shell script to auto commit and push and finally I was learning some English (I need someone to practice speaking altogether with me).

10/02/2019
---
It was a pleasant Sunday. I was at the church, then we had a family dinner. I watched a ski jumping competition and drove to Bialystok. That's how the day looked like in a shortcut üòâ.

11/02/2019
---
Arghh.. We've got something incorrectly configured on our systems and one thing doesn't want to work. It took me the whole day to figure it and all I know for now is - it doesn't work. It's really bad when things like this happends especially when you have other tasks to do in this week.

12/02/2019
---
Yesterday's problem. Not solved. Anyway I'll create a ticket to support for help on that topic and I want to focus my attention on other tasks. I have a new task with some changes in the code. The code is 3-4 months old but it is already defined as legacy code. No tests and I want to improve this code better by entering tests for this code!

13/02/2019
---
Today in the flat I rent the owners made some renovation. When I came back from work, they were still here painting the walls. I also have a new bed. Much more comfortable than the previous one :).

14/02/2019
---
It's almost the end of the week. Time flies by so fast ... Today I worked a little bit longer (officialy 8h in the office) and 3 hours at home because tomorrow we have a meeting about topic I didn't know very well. That's why I worked after hours to 'get in' the topic. Anyway tomorrow probably I'll finish 3 hours earlier :)

15/02/2019
---
Yooho! Friday :). With friends I was at the swimming pool and I ate strawberries today! It was yummy..

16/02/2019
---
I spent todays evening with my friends. We were sitting in their flat and we chatted about life and other stuff.

17/02/2019
---
Today, with family we had a little celebration day. It was my mom's birthday. It was a good time with family (and cake :D).

18/02/2019
---
I had to submit documents for studies, so I left work at 12 in the morning and went to university. When I submitted my master's degree papers, there were two levels of English to choose from: B2 + and C1. I do not feel up to level C1, but all B2 + slots have been filled, so I had to ... I'm not sure if this decision about studying is good, but we'll see :)

19/02/2019
---
Arghh!! I got angry so bad today! I had an appointment to a doctor at 10:45. I was in there right on time. I registered, there were a few people in front of me (like 5 or 6). Everything was fine until now. After 2 hours of waiting I couldn't take it anymore (I had a meeting at 1 PM) I asked what my position was in the queue.... I was 4th. I just took my papers and left.

20/02/2019
---
Ha!! I planned to go to the doctor on Thursday but I decided to back to my hometown today and ... I did papers for studies in 30 min instead of 2 hours of waiting in queue :)!

21/02/2019
---
Another good day :). I worked remotely today. I really like to work like this especially at the summer time when you can go outside and get some sun + do some work. Additionally I went on swimming pool (as always), had some chill time ... ;)

22/02/2019
---
Ye!! Friday :). I went on swimming pool with my cousin today, it was nice. There is also a new schedule for my master's studies, which doesn't look bad. I have a busy Monday and Tuesday, but other days looks good :)

23/02/2019
---
That was a good day! We had 'holiday' at our church. There was many people and friends. Afterwards with a group of friends we went to my aunt house and we were chatting :)

24/02/2019
---
I almost forgot to write today's note. Uff... I used this beautiful Sunday to meet my friends and be with family. :D

25/02/2019
---
What a day. Literally, I didn't have time to do anything. I went out at 10am and returned at 8pm. Mondays are gonna be tough.

26/02/2019
---
Today I had classes related to math... Aaaaa I'm scared a bit. I've always been terrible in math and I think it's not better now.

27/02/2019
---
And we're at the middle of the week. Today I had less classes so I could spend some time on my own things. In addition I ate a good lunch (vegetables and rice).

28/02/2019
---
That was the last day of February. Today I was at the jSession, which is java communicy meeting. There was 2 presentations - first about how to not make our code legacy and the second one about AWS and serverless. Meetings like that are a great occassion to meet new people.

01/03/2019
---
Friday and the new month. Sounds great! :). I did back to my hometown and went to the swimming pool with my cousins. Arghh! And one more thing. My car broke down, luckily after returning home. I don't know much about car mechanics, so tomorrow with my dad we'll see together what happened there.

02/03/2019
---
I spent the day at home. I had fun with my brother's son :). Unfortunately, the problem with the car is serious and I have to give it to the mechanic.

03/03/2019
---
It was regular Sunday. I went to church and then we had a family dinner. In the evening I went to the city where I work (I borrowed a car from my parents).

04/03/2019
---
Monday.. Actually, I like Mondays. It's not always easy to handle a new week, but when you have a good approach, you can do it. I can do it for sure (ofc. sometimes there are bad moments but this is rare). 

05/03/2019
---
This is the last day of my breath hold challenge! I found it very usefull, but unfortunately I don't have time for it (even if it takes 20 minutes a day). I'm glad that recently I don't have so many tasks at work so I can focus more on my studying.

06/03/2019
---
That was interesting day. Ofc. a lot of studying, but today it was something different. I was creating very simple app in react-native. First I had to configure to make it work altogether with Java 11, which took me a while. At the late afternoon I got an email with a job offer which is quite interesting... I'm already on 2 projects so we'll see where this whole situation will go.

07/03/2019
---
What a day! Until afternoon everything was going smoothly. And at one moment, EMAIL, EMAIL, EMAIL... that was overwhelming. Thanks God, I manage to prioritize the tasks that came and I solved them one by one. Well, not exactly all of them but at least I'm at good starting point for tomorrow continuation ;)

08/03/2019
---
Today I had a job interview with a HR recruiter. We talked on the phone for an hour and on next Wednesday I have technical interview. If I succeed I'll have a lot of work to do... But we'll see after Wednesday :)  

09/03/2019
---
I wanted to learn math today, but I was preparing myself for job interview. I also met with my friends and went to a hairdresser (which is actually my friend). And ofc. I went to the pool :)

10/03/2019
---
I always try to be positive but what happend today.... makes me RAGE! Our new roommate has invited some of his 'friends' BUT these weren't normal people (I'm sorry to say this), they were bums who stink terribly and what is worse THEY STAY FOR A NIGHT! It's 100% certain that tomorrow I'm calling the owner of the aparment to talk about it. And it's me or him. Someone has to leave.

11/03/2019
---
When I woke up I was still angry. I called owner of our flat and described the situation. She wasn't happy (in warm words). Fortunatelly situation is established right now and hopefully it won't ever happen again.

12/03/2019
---
It was a very ordinary day. Work -> School -> Work -> Studying. In the end, our new roommate didn't cause problems in the evening but anyway we need to get rid of him (we don't trust him and we can't lock our rooms).

13/03/2019
---
I had technical job interview today. It was very interesting. The guy, who had conversation with me asked me a lot of questions where I had to think instead of know something. I don't know if they'll offer me job after this talk but still, it was very nice talk.

14/03/2019
---
Hi! It was a good day. I had better in my life but it was fine :). I'm thinking of find new flat to rent 'cause I'm tired of living here with that new roommate and actually I'm kind of scared of him.

15/03/2019
---
I got sick :(. The whole day I felt terrible and I went sleep at 5 pm..

16/03/2019
---
Wow! I slept 14 hours!! And what is most important I felt good today :). I'm not sick anymore. Today I met with my friends and also went on swimming pool.

17/03/2019
---
Today I celebrated friend birthday üéÇ! It was a good Sunday with beautiful weather. I wish spring to come faster :)

18/03/2019
---
Another really weird day!!! My roommate (not the new one) went CRAZY! He wanted to commit suicide... He left a farewell letter etc.. I lost all afternoon and evening dealing with the police and so on.I also told our owner of the aparment that I'm leaving and I don't want to live there anymore. She totally understood this. Ultimately, the roommate was found and is safe.

19/03/2019
---
It was a good day. At the evening we met with few friends on pizza. Good and fun time. I needed that :)

20/03/2019
---
I finished things related to renting an apartment. I paid (a lot) for the last 2 months and gave the keys to the owner.

21/03/2019
---
Bum! My job offer was rejected. They say that they need someone more experienced and I can try again in 4-6 months. I have to learn more and start sharing my knowledge :)

22/03/2019
---
Yuuhuuu! Friday :). I'm thinking of starting some new project where I can use Spring, Hibernate, Angular etc.. In general new technologies... I really don't want to have any technical debt. I have to find problem which is interesting to me so I'll be motivated and have fun.

23/03/2019
---
It was beautiful Saturday! Sun was shining and the weather was perfect. Life is wonderful! We have to remember this :)

24/03/2019
---
Today was my grandma's birthday. All family met up altogether to celebrate. We had a typical village dinner. It was a good time. Afterwards 'young' generation moved to another party (including me). Also.. great time with friends :)

25/03/2019
---
Monday! I like Mondays :). It was very casual. First work, then school and finally relax - swimming pool with friends.

26/03/2019
---
Today I had a short conversation with IT recruiter from Great Britain. It's a nice experience to talk about job and opportunities in language other than native. He offered me job in Warsaw. I agreed on technical interview but anyway if they won't offer me remote work I think I'll reject this offer.

27/03/2019
---
Very simple day. At the morning I drove to Bialystok on the University. At noon I went to the office and after work (around 3:30 PM) I drove back home. At home I was studying :)

28/03/2019
---
Today I read a lot about Docker and Collections in Java. I also practice some things in Docker (docker's classroom). At the evening I went out on swimming pool with cousin. We were chatting and chilling :) 

29/03/2019
---
Time flies by so fast... Sometimes I would like to stop him, sit down and do nothing. I'll do it in May, on my birthday. I'll sit and watch the sunset without worrying about anything!

30/03/2019
---
The running season is officialy started! Today, I ran 4.5km with an average pace (5:00/km). I felt so good after running. The weather was PERFECT. It was a beautiful sunset. And all the nature in the heart of the forest! There are no words to describe this view :)

31/03/2019
---
Last day of March! Time going so fast.. Today I resigned from meeting friends. Instead I was learning for classes for upcoming week. I'm not sure if it was best choice but it's already history :)

01/04/2019
---
April!! The day was fine. Nothing special happend. Tomorrow I have another job interview (phone call). I don't have big hopes for that. It's more to know where I am and what is market looking for at this moment. 

02/04/2019
---
Today I had another technical interview. It was a conversation over the phone. Generally, my impressions are good. I know what my weaknesses are (Spring, more advanced things). I also know my strengths. It's time for learning! Work hard now, it'll pay off later :) 

03/04/2019
---
Another wonderful day :). I have a lot of tasks to-do in work. I know I'll do them well if God will bless me! In life, it is really important to be thankfull for what we have and don't complain!! I have food, clothes, car and some money in the pocket. You know what?? I'm rich! :)

04/04/2019
---
Uff... Long day. I worked really hard today. I took a break for workout and lunch. It was necessary, otherwise my brain would explode. In the evening I went to the swimming pool with a few friends. We had a funny time.. :)

05/04/2019
---
Once again in was really tough Friday. I had a lot of work. Sometimes I feel so overwhelmed and to be honest I would like to forget about all things related to work and go anywhere... I love what I do, but sometimes it's HARD... especially when you work with old technologies :(

06/04/2019
---
It was beautiful weather outside today!! I really love it. I played with the Docker today. I created Tomcat server image, configured few things and so on. Docker is really powerful!

07/04/2019
---
This Sunday was strange. Most of my friends went out somewhere, so we couldn't meet up. I decided to spent the Sunday at home. I had some work to do. I started my job stuff at 3 pm and I finished at 10 pm! I didn't feel that time, it was really strange.

08/04/2019
---
Today I'll share some of my thoughts. Self-discipline is very important in life. Thanks to her, we can stick to our plans, grow up (mentally and physically) and we're trustworthy! First of all - we don't lie to ourselves. For example: you tell yourself that you will go to the gym at least 3 times a week. And you did only for 2 weeks... You lied yourself! Don't do this! Stick to your plans. And what is important - have a plan!

09/04/2019
---
I don't know why but I hate English classes on my studies. My goal for 2019 is to learn English in more advanced level but I hate do that at the University. Is it something wrong with me?

10/04/2019
---
It was a good day. I wrote simple app in react-native that uses devices sensors. I slept approximately 1 hour during the day. I went on swimming pool with my cousin. Yeahh... definitely a good day ;)

11/04/2019
---
I spent all day at home. Tomorrow I have a meeting with the team where we'll discuss what to implement and how. This is very important especially to me, because I'm the main developer in the project. I've prepared the short presentation which covers what we want to achieve and what is unclear.

12/04/2019
---
As I wrote yesterday, today we had a meeting with the team to discuss new feature. It went well. It wasn't said clearly but we'll (me especially) work in scrum. In next 2 weeks I have to show what is done and what is stil missing. I like that idea :)

13/04/2019
---
I think it's a really good routine that I write here every day. What if I didn't do it? Well.. I think my English would be on a lower level. I really like doing it!

14/04/2019
---
What a great Sunday! We celebrated our uncle's 45th birthday with all our family. It was an amazing time :)

15/04/2019
---
Today I've been on swimming pool with my friends. Really cool time. We chatted and had fun :).

16/04/2019
---
To be honest I don't know what to say for today. It's already the next day and I'm sitting in front of the window. It's a beautiful morning outside. I love this view..

17/04/2019
---
Today I finally ran 5 km. The time was good - 4:55min/km. I felt tired after the run and I know that my condition is not in the right place yet. However, I have time to overcome another goal for 2019 (run 5km below 22min) and while training more, I'm closer to this goal!

18/04/2019
---
This week I have a lot of work to do in both projects. In addition I have studies and of course there are homework there. I know that if God helps me and gives me wisdom to understand everything, it'll be easy!

19/04/2019
---
It's beautifull weather outside. In the morning I ran 4km with decent pace. Afterwards I worked during whole day. In the meantime I was tanning and I did a workout. In the evening I went on swimming pool with my cousins.

20/04/2019
---
I tried to write application for studies today but I didn't felt very productive.. I just made some fun with docker and tomcat server. I've found out that tomcat actually is not really EE server, it's just container for servlets. It's good to know :)

21/04/2019
---
Easter time :). What is most important about this holiday is that Jesus Christ died and after three days got alive. For all the people on the world. Keep that in mind and thanks the Lord everyday for everything He's giving you.

22/04/2019
---
It was a great Monday. In the morning with the whole family we went to church. Then we had a familly dinner. Afterwards I went to my friends. We were chatting and had a really good time. That's what I was missing lately - to stop and enjoy life üñêüñê

23/04/2019
---
The first day at work after Easter. I put on a little bit and these are not muscles :( I think I have to start going to the gym to build muscle mass instead of being slim. I like to run but it burns my muscles instead of building them.

24/04/2019
---
Today I went to see a new flat, which I bought with my parents. There was not the first stunning impression, but I appreciate it and I think it is nice.

25/04/2019
---
It was long day. I have important task to do with deadline to Monday, so I worked veeery long today. Weather outside is BEAUTIFUL, everything blooms. Tomorrow I'll use the weather and I'll work outstide! 

26/04/2019
---
Today was summer. 27 degrees outside. I decided to work in the backyard and it was a great decision. I literally love the weather like today!!!üòçüòç

27/04/2019
---
It was another good day. Again - the weather was perfect. I'm grateful to God for everything he gives... even small things like the weather üôÇüôÇ

28/04/2019
---
Today we celebrated easter once again! :). It was a good time spent together with friends. The weather wasn't as sunny as a few days earlier but it was nice anyway.

Monday... It was another good Monday! üòä. Since my morning habits are everyday, almost every Monday is good, especially when I wake up and see the glowing sun. Today at work I had a little demo preview. We talked with the product owner and one guy on the client's side.Everything went well, they are satisfied and I'm also happy with the work I have done. üëä

Last day of April. Whaaat?! I said that few times here but I'll say it again - time flies by so fast.

01/05/2019
---
Today I was helping my dad at work in the yard. It's good to do some physical work from time to time instead of clicking on the keyboard üòÑüòÑ 

02/05/2019
---
I spent the whole day at home. In the evening I went out to buy some food and that's all. I worked on projects for studies that are quite interesting and certainly educate - this is what studies are for üòÉ


03/05/2019
---
It was a funny day. In the late afternoon I went out on swimming pool with couple of friends and we met other friends there. Finally we finished our evening together on grill üëçüëç


04/05/2019
---
Today was my birthday. I spent 25 years on this Earth, thanks God I'm all healthy and actually have everything I want/need to have.

05/05/2019
---
Birthdays after birthdays... Today we celebrated my nephew birthday. He's one and so adorable. I really love him and when I look at him sometimes I think I want kid too üòÖ

08/05/2019
---
Hahaa! I just noticed that I lost few days in my titles. I wanted to type 06/05 and then I realized - HEY DUDE! IT WAS A FEW DAYS AGO! To be honest I have no idea when I forgot to write something because all the time for over few months I didn't look at the date in computer but always on date in previous title.

09/05/2019
---
What a great day. Of course I worked a lot (7am-6pm) but if you really like your job you don't feel bad about it. I really like my work (maybe even love) and it's a pleasure (though not always). However, after work I went out with friends. First we went to the swimming pool and then eat some fast food. It was a good time üëäüëä

10/05/2019
---
Long Friday. I didn't do anything super interesting. It was a very ordinary day. Work, training, some shopping, tv series and sleep.

11/05/2019
---
Wedding day!! Today I celebrated my friends wedding. It was really cool - many friends, good food. I talked a lot and had a good time üëçüëç

12/05/2019
---
I have no idea what happened to me today but I was miserable and very unproductive. I slept a lot during the day and felt alone. It wasn't good day to me..

13/05/2019
---
It was a good day. If I compare it to yesterday then it's even PERFECT day haha :D. It was very ordinal, work, studies...

14/05/2019
---
I was so tired after this day... I worked the whole day and one more additional thing... In my new apartment there is a fan in the kitchen and when it's windy otustide this fan all the time produces weird noises. It drives me totally crazy!!

15/05/2019
---
Home sweet home.. I'm back in my hometown again (after 3 days absence :D). It's always good to be here. Today at the swimming pool I realized that I'm fat or bigger than I expected! üò™üò™ I need to do something with that!

16/05/2019
---
What a great day! Today I choose very wisely - what does it mean?! Well... I went out with my friends. First, we went on the swimming pool and then to the house of one of our friends. It was blessed time. Honestly, I had doubts - go home, eat something healthy and  work or go with friends, eat a pizza and talk. I chose the latter option and I don't regret my decision üòâüòâ

17/05/2019
---
Ahh! Today we had beautiful weather. It's shocking that in May this is like 3rd day with such weather. The other days are usually cloudy, windy or cold... I went for running to the forest today and it's wonderful there. Everything grows up and comes to life.. 

18/05/2019
---
It was a good day. I spent it at home, doing homework for studies and watching League of Legends. In the evening I went to run and ran 3km :)

19/05/2019
---
Another wonderful day! Today, with friends we celebrated the birthday of one of our friends. The funniest thing is that the weather stations said it would rain, but ultimately it was a beautiful day :)

20/05/2019
---
It was tough day. In the morning I deployed a new version of our product and it had bugs!! So I literally spent the whole day to fix it. And between that time I still had to be at the university.

21/05/2019
---
Hmm... What can I say about today?! I don't know - this is very popular answer and I use it very often, too often... I have to be more creative and more inspiring. I have no idea how, but I know I have to start doing somthing into this. Taking first step is always difficult..üòè 

22/05/2019
---
Continuing yesterday's thoughts.. Storytelling is a really creative task. If you want to tell your story in an interesting way... This is a task I want to learn.üëäüëä

23/05/2019
---
It was a great day! First - I solved many issues from our JIRA. There wasn't much code to write there, it was more like analyzing and rewriting a few lines of code. Then I had a good workout - my goal is to do at least 3 workouts a week and it was the second. And finally, in the evening I went out with my friends. We went on the swimming pool and had fun üëçüëç

24/05/2019
---
I'm siting on my chair and I don't know what to write. It was normal day. Oo! I know! Tomorrow in our church we have a conference. I hope there'll be some new people to meet and that God will bless that time.

25/05/2019
---
Today - as I mentioned yesterday - we had a conference in our church. There was a lot of people. I met a few new people and spent time with those I already knew. It was a good time üòâüòâ

26/05/2019
---
It was one of the best Sunday's in my entire life. I finally understood what life is really about. I want to have this energy and motivation! For everyone who look for the answer what is the most important in our life - it's not money, job or even family. It's God and we should be focused to serve him as much as we can!

27/05/2019

I was at the dentist today to get rid of wisdom teeth. It was the first visit, so the doctor only carried out an inspection and planned the date of the operation. And you know what? The first available date is April 2020 üòÑüòÑ. I took it :D.

28/05/2019
---
It was a productive day. I talked to my boss, I actually wrote about the promotion and we arranged a meeting for the next week. I solved one major task and came up with the idea of how to finish the next one. I also decided to go to 'SlƒÖsk' and confirmed this decision to my cousin. For now and forever - STOP wasting time :)

29/05/2019
---
Another wonderful day! My friend invited me to the grill and I agreed. It was so cool and chill. There was around 15 people, we were chatting and so on. I had really, really good fun! üòÄüòÄ

30/05/2019
---
It was another beautiful day. Well... in the morning I received bad information - my work colleague got sick - and I have to take all of her responsibilities. Anyway, the whole day was ideal. Our German colleagues had a national holiday so noone was interrupting my work.üòÖüòÖ

31/05/2019
---
Just few sentences about today. It wasn't an easy day. As I mentioned yesterday, I went to the western side of Poland - Silesia. This means I had 7h of travel. And when it comes to work... I was creating parser and after 4h of work I realized that it isn't easy task. Maybe it's not even possible :(

01/06/2019
---
It's June! This day was really good. We had a good time here (in Silesia). I have seen and have had a short conversation with many members of my family and I am generally happy that I am here :)

02/06/2019
---
Another wonderful day :) We were in the church and it was blessing time! Today we also drove back to our eastern side of Poland. Thank God we arrived without any problems.

03/06/2019
---
Today I had to work overhours. This is because tomorrow we have key users training and someone (me) had to prepare system. üòé

04/06/2019
---
It was another great day. It's very hot in Poland - it looks like the summer has come to us :). That's good! I can't wait to get back to my hometown and sunbathe.

05/06/2019
---
Today I had a periodic conversation with my boss. It's really useful to have this talk at least once a year. In the evening I went out with friends and had a pleasant evening.

06/06/2019
---
Finally in hometown ... ;) I want to enjoy the weather outside!! Today with my roommate (we're renting a room for our friend) I ran 3km. The pace on last kilometer was my best in 2019!üí™üí™

07/06/2019
---
Today I realized that I have a lot of work on my studies - 2 individual projects, 1 group project and 1 math exam. The last one will probably take most of my time and energy. I really want to create interesting projects, but because I don't have time I'm afraid it will be medium.

08/06/2019
---
It was a very productive day! I was studying math and doing project for studies in react native. In the evening I went out for a bike with my cousin. The weather outside is great! I really love and appreciate days like this! Thanks GOD for that!!!üòäüòä

09/06/2019
---
Very sunny Sunday. However I'm not entirely happy how I spent it. I didn't visit anyone. I were sitting home all day and studying. :(

10/06/2019
---
Mo mo Monday. I'm grateful for this day! Today I went to Bialystok and unfortunately I was stuck in traffic. It was caused by a car accident and the road was closed for 40 minutes. Well.. nobody died and it was good to stand there and do nothing :)

11/06/2019
---
Ehh!! I don't think I can learn math in 2 days! :(. This is my mistake, I should start this at least a month ago... Well, hope is still alive, the first attempt is on Thursday, the second for 2 weeks. If God help me everything is possible.üí™üí™

12/06/2019
---
I decided to not to go to the office today. Instead I stayed at home and the whole day I was learning math! After all day my hand is sore!! I hope, God will help me on exam üôè

13/06/2019
---
Today was the day of truth - do I know enough to pass exam? The answer is 'I don't know', haha üòÖ. It wasn't tough. If I started to learn a few days earlier I could pass it without a problem. But I didn't do it and now I'm not sure if I have solved the tasks correctly and whether I'll pass in the first attempt.

14/06/2019
---
Wonderful day :). Everything is green, I mean all the trees, grass.. Thanks God for all the creation!

15/06/2019
---
It was a nice Saturday. In the morning I went out for run and ran 3 km. Then I was studying, did a workout and finally went to the bike with my friend in the evening üí™üí™. There is BEAUTIFUL weather outside and I want to use it 100%!!!

16/06/2019
---
Ehh üò•. I didn't pass math exam in the first attempt. I'm really curious what mistakes I made. Well.. the good point is that I have still over a week to study and that I know what to expect but still it would be much better if I pass it in the first attempt.

17/06/2019
---
Monday Monday Monday.. I love Mondays üòÑ. Today I almost finished this semester - the only thing that left is math exam. 

18/06/2019
---
I ran 3 km today with good pace. If I want to achieve my goal to run 5km under 22 minutes I have to start running longest distances, otherwise I won't complete it.

19/06/2019
---
Today I went on a bike with my cousin. We had interesting conversations about life and business. I think that my goal for 2020 will be something related to my own business. Even if it fails, I want to at least try.

20/06/2019
---
Another beautiful day! Today we had national holiday in Poland so it was non-working day. And yes - I didn't write any line of code but instead of that I wrote a lot of math exercises on paper. 

21/06/2019
---
Yoo hoo, Friday! One more tough week left. In next Thursday I have last exam (I guess) and this semester studying will be finally off!

22/06/2019
---
I spent this Saturday lonely. Only me and math.. I really want to pass this exam and finally have few days of relief...

23/06/2019
---
Sunday!! I was in the church celebrating baptism. You know.. I have other profession of faith - Pentecostal, and in our faith we don't baptize children. Anyway.. after all there was a big lunch for everyone, cake, games and good positive atmosphere!

24/06/2019
---
Pam pam pam.. Monday :)! It's a new week, which means new challenges. The biggest challenge for me this week is to pass my math exam! I was studying a lot for the last 2 weeks and I hope that God will give me a wisdom to do it.

25/06/2019
---
Today I had another great run! Last time I beat my personal record on 3 km's (12:28) and today it was 12:55 - which is also a great result for me!

26/06/2019
---
Ulala! I was informed that tomorrow I'll get new laptop! That's good news :). I have to prepare all the data for migrations! And tomorrow I have math exam!!

27/06/2019
---
Crazy day... I had this math exam and again I'm not 100% sure if I pass it. I mean I wrote a lot, but... who knows if it was correct? :D. Anyway... I got new laptop!! Yu huu! It's really cool! 

28/06/2019
---
End of the working week.. Today I visited my friend and he cut my hair (yeahh... that's my private hairdresser :D). Well...I don't know what else I can say. I'm waiting for the results from the math exam. It should be announced on Monday.

29/06/2019
---
Nice Saturday! Finally I had free time!!!! I could do whatever I wanted! And I did :). First I cleaned up my room, then helped a little in the 'Strongbox' open source project - I configured the project to work with Java 9. Late in the afternoon I went for a short nap and finally visited my friends in the evening! It's great to have so much time! :)

30/06/2019
---
Last day of June. Wow! Half of the year is already gone!! Question is: what did I do in this time? Well.. I know what I did because everything is tracked down here and how about you? üòÑ.

01/07/2019
---
Monday :) I like Mondays üëç. I have task at work which isn't specified in 100% - I mean it's unclear how it should be implemented. But I have to do it somehow... I don't like when something is not precisely told, but at least I'm getting some new experience in 'unclear' area üòÇüòÇ

02/07/2019
---
I went to the office today. I had to return the external drive I took last week. It's always a bit of a wasted time - 2 hours on the go but I had to... The upside is that during the driving I listen to podcasts ;)

03/07/2019
---
Mid of the week üòé. Weather in Poland have definitely changed out. It's 20 Celsius degrees and very windy outside. I don't like this!

04/07/2019
---
I did it! I beat my 5km record with stunning result - 21:31!! WoW! I remember few months ago when I was running and telling myself 'dude, 5km under 22 minutes is impossible'... well, with God's help everything is possible!

05/07/2019
---
Wedding day! Yuhuuu! Friends of mine got married :). It was amazing wedding! A lot of friends, good food, and fun fun fun :)!

06/07/2019
---
Today I had a lot of activities. I woke up at 9am. At 10:30 I went on bike with my cousin. It took 2 hours. Then at 1 PM. we went to the 'day after wedding party'. There was grill, volleyball, a lot of friends, etc. In general, we spent time together... Awesome day ;)

07/07/2019
---
Another Sunday has passed... Since a week the weather in Poland is awful and the forecasts are not promising for the next week :(. Unfortunately my vacation starts tomorrow :D ... life üòÖüòÖ  

08/07/2019
---
Today I realized how impatient I am. I should work on it. Btw. Monday and the first day of my 2 week holiday - it's very cold and windy outside.üò™

09/07/2019
---
I decided that I'm not going to Kopanica. This's a Christian camp that we went to almost every year... This year it's too cold and I have many other things to do.

10/07/2019
---
I got sick! :( What a pity... I think that the list of things to do this week overwhelmed me, as a result of which I fell ill. In addition, the weather is (in warm words) not cool and I can't go on a bike or running üò•

11/07/2019
---
Another day I'm sick :( I felt terrible today, I slept in more than two hours during the day and I was freezing ... Now that I'm writing, it's a lot better üëçüëç

12/07/2019
---
YES! Finally the weather is slightly better üëç. I felt much better today - I mowed the lawn and did 15km by a bike. I need nice weather to be active üòÖüòÖ

13/07/2019
---
Another day with wonderful weather üòä. I was sunbathing on the yard and enjoying this day :)

14/07/2019
---
Sunday ... :) I played in a volleyball today. We had barbecue and fun üòâüòâ

15/07/2019
---
It's a year since I write daily notes regularly. Lately I'm thinking about VLOGing also. That's very hard to overcome that fear of not beeing anonymous on the Internet. You know... you have to show your face to the others and get used to camera.. But who knows.. maybe in the future üòè

16/07/2019
---
Ehh!!! AGAIN the weather is crap! I hate that.. I think I took my vacations in worst possible time if we talk about weather.

17/07/2019
---
Today I had technical job interview talk. I have really big technical debt... And I know in current job there is no future :/. Company itself is great, boss is great but projects or maybe technologies used in that projects are crap üò•.

18/07/2019
---
That was a good day :). I finally sat down and started to record youtube tutorial on image processing. Procrastination is my great enemy. I need to learn how to fight it... Actually I know, I have to act instead of looking for other activities üòè

19/07/2019
---
I feel amazing üòä. After almost 2 weeks of procrastinations with recording a video tutorial I finally did it! Yes, it's not perfect and I don't have the feeling that thousands of people will watch it. Anyway, I fought with myself and won üëäüëè

20/07/2019
---
Another wonderful day... especially the evening :). It was a normal Saturday but in the late afternoon my friend invited me to his home. I rejected his offer, so he offered to come to me. I agreed. We had a great evening. We talked and it was really nice time. Ahh.. and the weather was perfect üòä

21/07/2019
---
Ohh... I realized I forgot to write something about Sunday... It's Tuesday morning already and what I remember I spent good time with friends on Sunday. We played volleyball, ate some food from grill and talked each other :)

22/07/2019
---
Mooonday üòçüòç. I really missed that ... all the meetings and work to do. Weather outside also started to being beautiful so I also have more energy! üòÅ

23/07/2019
---
Another great day! Today I got confirmation about my travel to the client. So in 2 weeks I'm going to Germany for a week. Actually I'm happy because of that, I wasn't there for a long time - 8 months!ü§ó

24/07/2019
---
Work, work, work.. A lot of work to do this week. I know everything will pay off so I give 100% of myself. In the evening, to de-stress I went on a bike with my cousin. We've made 20 km üòé

25/07/2019
---
Time flies by like crazy üòè. It's Thursday already! I have everything prepared for my travel to Germany (plane, hotels, car rent). I just need to get details how much cash I need and if everything is paid already or not. I have a week for that üëçüëä 

26/07/2019
---
Last days are really crazy. I'm in the position where I want to change company. The motivation to do this is due to the technology I currently work with... It's legacy and I know that I can't learn much more in that area + it'll not be useful in the future. I feel a little bad just because of my boss who was a great boss so far üëè

27/07/2019
---
Ahh! What a great Saturday! I've been learning a lot about business - especially about what I need to create my own, law in the Poland, etc... There's so much to learn in this area or maybe I should say too much ...üòÖ

28/07/2019
---
I watched F1 race today (in TV). It was the best race in 2k19... so many turnovers, crashes and unexpected situations. In addition I was learning about creating my own business üôÇ

29/07/2019
---
Monday Monday Monday... It means a lot of work üòÖ. We have new problems on the project and in a week we have go-live (final presentation of our solution). I've been writing a lot about work lately, but of course I also have a private life üòÄ. For example, today we were on bikes with my cousins.

30/07/2019
---
Another wonderful day :). Lately I'm very stressed because of job change... I'm not entirely convinced that I should do it but I know that it can be very promising, so I think it's worth to take a risk and change job. üòè

31/07/2019
---
Uhh... I was really worried about today. I had to tell my boss that I want to change job. And someone may ask: dude, why you were worried about it? Well... it's simple - my boss was always fair to me and I think it might be tough to find a boss like him. Anyway he offered me a new project and of course - better money. Now I'm hesitating what to choose ü§î

01/08/2019
---
It was decision day... and I decided to stay at current company. Main motivation was that since September I'll be moved to another project, that have more advanced and interesting technologies. Of course, other important point is that money are better but I think that is normal - we sell our time and we expect to be paid, right? üòè

02/08/2019
---
At last the weekend begins üòÉ! I do not have any special plans, but I'm glad that in the end I will be able to rest a bit. This week a lot has happened, especially in the area of work. Thank God for the opportunities that he gave me üòä.

03/08/2019
---
Another great day. I had to pack myself 'cause tomorrow I'm flying off to Germany - yeahh... to be honest it took my like 1 hour max (hopefully I didn't forget anything üòÅ). Today we had also family grill. It is always good to sit together, have a little conversation and relax with good food ‚ò∫Ô∏è. 

04/08/2019
---
Travel time ‚úàÔ∏è üöó. It was a long day. In the morning I went to church and right after that I ate veeeery fast lunch and drove to Warsaw. Then I had to get to the airport.. Right after landing in Stuttgart I took my baggage and went to a car rental place. I almost rented Fiat500 but the woman that works in the desk (million thanks!) gave me something better - Ford Fiesta (but that's some sport edition). Finally, after 1 hour travel I finally got into hotel üòä.

05/08/2019
---
First day on-site... And of course we encounter some issues that we struggled for the whole day... Eventually we solved that so working day ended well. After work we went for a dinner and we were chatting until the very evening üëä ‚úä ü§õ 

06/08/2019
---
Uff.. Tough day. From the very morning we had problems with system but again at the end of day everything runs well üëç. Again after work we had 30-40 minutes break in the hotel and aftewards we went on a dinner. Important thing - now we don't have lunches at client - they have vacations üò™. It's sad, I liked their food!

07/08/2019
---
We had plans for today to visit 'Metzingen outlet', unfortunately we wokred until 6 pm and that destroyed our plans. It wasn't the best day. My team leader was informed that I leave project since September and the atmosphere wasn't so pleasant üò™. Well... I don't feel bad because of it, that's not my fault that technologies in this project are boring and old... As a developer I need and I want to learn, do something new, something interesting üëäüëä. 

08/08/2019
---
Last day on-site at the client, the last time I see these people (since September I'm on a new project). I'm quite happy, we had a ton of work to do and to be honest I'm shocked at how poorly everything was managed. This's the end of the project and most of the components have not been tested... Every day we had to prepare quick fixes, sometimes even few times per day... Anyway, I arrived to the hotel next to the airport at Stuttgart (first I got lost in the hotel üòÇ) and tomorrow I'm flying to Poland üòä.

09/08/2019
---
Home sweet home üè†. I ate a great delicious breakfast at the hotel. Then I went to the airport, which was very close (200m) and flew to üáµüá± There was a strong wind and quite turbulence during the landing, but thank God we landed in Warsaw at noon. Later I just took my car and went home :).

10/08/2019
---
What a beautiful Saturday ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è!! Today we had a big holiday in our church - baptism. The weather was really nice - not too hot, not too cold. After baptism we had good time, where everyone could talk to each other, there was a food and it was super cool. I really appreciate moments in my life like this üëç.

11/08/2019
---
Sunday üòä. I spent entire day at church. We had a dinner together after devotion. It was a good time. In the evening I went to my cousins we've made waffles with some toppings. üòÅ

12/08/2019
---
It was another wonderful Monday üëäüëç. I had few bugs report which I solved really fast and I had more time for myself. In the evening, I was invited to my cousin to hang out, talk, etc. It was a good time üòâ.

13/08/2019
---
Another crazy day üòç. I've been at Bialowieza forest with friends. I live 15 km next to it but I haven't been there since 10 years!! That's ridicilous üòÇ. We had a good time and after that we made a grill at my cousin parents house. It was a good time and to be honest I don't remember myself beeing that active and eager to do something üòÖüòÖ.

14/08/2019
---
Finally a day when I could spend the evening alone - no parties, no late sleeping... In short: I could rest :)

üëèüëè What a day! I woke up and went to run 4 km. Today was a national holiday in Poland so I didn't have to work and I had time :). In the late afternoon my 2 cousins and our friend from Germany decided to go out on bicycles. I did 32km (they did about 40 üí™üí™). I love days like this üòé.

16/08/2019
---
Another crazy evening üòÅand once again junk food at the evening üò™!! I can't say NO to junk food and have no idea why... Normally I don't eat things like this maybe that is the reason ? ü§î ü§®

17/08/2019
---
Today me and my cousin decided to go out and bike to Bialowieza - 17km next to our town. We did it and we made almost 60km overall! Once again it was the perfect day üòäüí™!

18/08/2019
---
Great Sunday :). It was my cousin's 18th birthday! She's already mature and I still remember how she was a little child üòÖüòÖ. Overall we had a great time :)!

19/08/2019
---
We had an integration meeting with my colleagues from the new team on the project, which I start from next month. It was nice to eat a burger for free (company cost üòÑüòÑ). 

20/08/2019
---
I had a lot of meetings today. The main one is about training I'm providing remotely and others are about projects I'm on :). On Thursday I have presentation about Git and I still don't know what I want to tell...üòìüòì

21/08/2019
---
It was another good day. At the noon I was informed that my git-presentation is canceled due to second speaker sick leave. I'm quite happy, especially that I wasn't sure what I want to tell so now I have more time to prepare  üòâ üòä.

22/08/2019
---
What a day üòØ! I've been writing the documentation to the module I implemented. During writing I noticed how many mistakes I made in architecture designing üò± ... And finally I started refactoring the code. Thanks God I've been writing unit tests so it's more easy üëçüëè.

23/08/2019
---
Friday üòç! Fridays are the best because weekend is there üòù. Today after work I called my cousin and we went out to ride a bike. We did almost 30 km üòä! Not bad, huh?

24/08/2019
---
My entire family went on holidays today so I'm home alone now üòÖ. Today was beautiful weather, I used it and sunbathed. I want to be more tanned than my parents after they back from holidays üòÇüòÇ!

25/08/2019
---
It was nice Sunday üôÇ. Very sunny and hot - exactly as I like üòé üòç! I'm slowly preparing myself for the new project. I hope that new technologies I'll step into won't overcome me ü§®!

26/08/2019
---
Today I had proposition to go to Kielce for projects handover. I suggested to do it remotely (I don't want to go in there now) and they agreed. So since tomorrow I'm starting projects handover üëç‚ò∫Ô∏è

27/08/2019
---
Another good day in my life üòâ. I've no idea what to write... it was a good, sunny day. As usual, I worked from early morning until late afternoon. I'm very grateful to God for everything I have in my life üôÇ

28/08/2019
---
And yet another day passed by. Once again the weather outside was great! Today I had a lot of meetings on my new project. I'm sure I'll learn a lot! üëçüëäüëè

29/08/2019
---
Uff üòØ! I wrote yesterday that I had a lot of meetings... Today it was like since 10 am until 3 pm I was on the calls. Crazy day!

30/08/2019
---
What a great day! Until noon I overhanded projects to the new guy and I started my onboarding process on my new project (I read a lot of documentation in provided Sharepoint). At 4PM I got an email that we have some problems with production system but I don't have details on that.... At 4:30 PM, me and my two cousins cycled to Bialowieza (+/- 20km next to us), ate pizza in there and we went back üòä.

31/08/2019
---
It was a great day indeed. I invited few people for a pizza for the evening. We had good time talking and enjoying food üòâ. 

01/09/2019
---
Ha! I had a little surprise today üòÖ! After devotion I went for a cycling. I did 20~kms and visited my cousin...actually part of our family was there, including grandma. I spent 30 min there and went home to watch F1, but my cousin invited our friends to my house (yee, my parents house, but they are on vacations üòÑ). We had a good time!

02/09/2019
---
The first day on the new project ü§ó. I received a ton of information and I'm glad that I can work with the latest technologies!! Thank God for this opportunity üòä!

03/09/2019
---
Another blessed day! Thank God for all the wisdom he giving me at work. In the evening (very late afternoon) I cycled 15 km with my roommate üëä. It was cold but worth it üí™!

04/09/2019
---
It was tough day... All day I straggled with containers to run everything I need smoothly. In addition I had introduction to front-end side where I also see that I'm not that advanced üòê. Well... I hope God will give me wisdom üôÇ!

05/09/2019
---
It was a much better day than yesterday. I worked really long and hard again üí™üí™. However I belive that this effort will be rewarded ü§ù üëç. In the evening I decided to run 5km because I didn't do it for a long time. I did it, and I ran whole distance in something around 23:30 - not bad, not good but I'm happy üëäüòâ.

06/09/2019
---
It was a great, great day! I finally resolved all the problems I had with environments and running the application! I found the bug in component that is provided by the other team which caused issues (and I struggled with that for hmm.... 2 days!!). Tomorrow we're going to Silesia for a baptism event. I won't be a driver and that's actually good. I can rest during the travel üòÑ. And one last - we have a great squad for our trip! üöóüëçüëä

07/09/2019
---
It was a great day! We drove Silesia and arrived in there at 3 pm with 2 stops on our way - quite good üëç.

08/09/2019
---
What a blessed day! Today we were celebrating baptism event. All weather forecasts said it would rain but thank God the weather was perfect üëç! Afterwards we went to church to have dinner together. It was a great time üòä. 

09/09/2019
---
I felt tired today üò™! I wanted to sleep and didn't have any energy for programming or think by myself. Hopefully tomorrow will be better ü§î.

10/09/2019
---
Today I felt much better than the day before. I had energy to work üëç- but because of meetings at the end of the day, I lost it üòë. After work I also cycled 30 km! I'm proud of it üòä.

11/09/2019
---
I think I need to change format of that daily writing... I mean it doesn't give me that much right now  ü§®(in context of learning English). I think this is a nice task for the next week to figure out how to improve it, because I really like that daily notes - it's a good habit üëçüëç.

12/09/2019
---
I took my first task on the new project and of course I found myself in weird situation. The changes I made affects on other components so it's not that straightforward to do üò™. Anyway I'm happy I finally started something ü§ó!

13/09/2019
---
It was a nice day. The weather outside wasn't the best (autumn is finally coming) but I appreciate this day. To be honest - I don't know why üòÑ.

14/09/2019
---
Today I spent a pleasant evening with young people from my church and surrounding churches. We met in the village called 'Reduty' which are 20 km from the town where I live. It was a good time we spent together. It's good to socialize with people üòÑüòÑ.

15/09/2019
---
Today I've been invited to an amazing lunch by my good friends ü§óüç≤. I decided to go there by bike (15km one way). It was a good decision because the food was so delicious and I could eat even more üòç(thanks to calories burned during cycling üòÄ). 

16/09/2019
---
Monday... most people hate that day üò•. For me it's a day like any other and I honestly like mondays üòÑ. I think this is because I like my job and what I do in my life üòä. Thank God for that!

17/09/2019
---
I got an offer to give a speech at my university. This's an interesting offer. On Thursday I have to answer if I'm decided or not ü§®. 

18/09/2019
---
It's very cold week but in my 'weekly plan' I decided to run 6km. Well... it's windy and cold but today I went for a run. I did half of the distance and it was ok üòè. 

19/09/2019
---
I said yes to the offer I received on Monday. I'll give a lecture and practice for students of the Bialystok University of Technology. I decided to talk about design patterns. I have some interesting ideas to discuss... I hope they'll like it üëçüëçüí™üí™.

20/09/2019
---
Friday ... It was a hard day ü§®. I had my hands full of work and I felt terrible after work. I was exhausted and had the strange feeling that I was sick (but I wasn't) üò¢üò≥. In addition, in the evening I decided to run 3 km. It was a good decision. After a run and a quick shower I felt good again üëç!

21/09/2019
---
Today I prepared a lunch for my parents. It was chicken with rice and vegetables. Quite tasty but I know I could prepare something better üòÉüòÉ.

22/09/2019
---
Ahh... it was a great Sunday! The weather outside was quite nice, if we look at it almost the end of September üòÆ! I was in the church in the morning and evening - it was a good time. In addition I cycled 20 km - just for relax üòÑüòÑ.

23/09/2019
---
Today I found out that one of my friends got engaged üò≤! His fiancee is really beautiful and I think she will be a wonderful wife. I wish them all the best! He really deserved it üë´.

24/09/2019
---
Another wonderful day! Today I met my good friend. We talked for 2 hours and then I went on a swimming pool with my cousin üèä. Mainly we used only sauna for relax üßñ. I really missed it üòç.

25/09/2019
---
Now I understand why programmers hate meetings...üò°. Today I had 5 hours of meetings ü§Øü§Øand to be honest there was a MAXIMUM 1 hour of useful information there!! Then I had a strange headache all day üò•. Next time I'll take the phone and go for a walk during these meetings.. 

26/09/2019
---
It was a good day though. I don't feel as much motivated as at the beginning of this week. I don't know what is wrong üò∞. Maybe it's because in next week I have to move to live in Bialystok (studies) ‚ùì‚ùî

27/09/2019
---
I think it was another good day in my life üëç. I've worked a lot today but I belive that all my efforts will eventually pay off üí≤üí≤üí≤(they already do). I ran 3 km today - just to relax and organize everything in my head üèÉüëü.

28/09/2019
---
Today I finally met with my best friend. We cycled about 20~km and talked at that time üö¥üëç. I really enjoy moments like these! üòâüòâ

29/09/2019
---
I spent the whole day at home üò∞.. I could go out with my friends but I decided not to. I don't think it was the right decision üò•. 

30/09/2019
---
Last day of September - fall is coming üåÇüß•üß§. Today I visited my friend - we were talking and had a good time. Afterwards I drove to Bialystok üöó. It's good that I have a place where to live but honestly I don't really like that big cities. I prefer to live in a little town (I guess :D).

01/10/2019
---
It was a tough day üòë... I had a problem at work that I couldn't resolve. The biggest problem is that if I can't resolve something I'm trying more and more. The result of that is that I worked for a whole day (and yes - I resolved it) üò´!

02/10/2019
---
Another exhausting day ü§Ø. Work + studies are really tough! I don't have time for my own things - today I haven't done the training that I do every Wednesday üò•. I hope that the next days will be better. 

03/10/2019
---
I drove home today and I realizied that the autumn is so beautiful! üöóüè°üçÇ Trees with diiferent colors, people are warmer (at least it is my opinion) - all of that makes me very grateful for God! üôè

04/10/2019
---
It was a very active day üí™! After work I decided to go to volleyball training üèêand then went to the pool with my friends üèä. Overall it was a really good day :)

05/10/2019
---
It was a good Saturday ‚ù§Ô∏è. I learned new things about the maven tool üë©üèª‚Äçüíª. In the evening I went to my friend for a haircut and then we went for a run üèÉ

06/10/2019
---
Coooold... It was very cold outside today ‚ùÑÔ∏è. I think nothing special happened today - in the morning, I was in church and in the evening I went to Bialystok.

07/10/2019
---
Work > studies > work üò´... For a year I'll have more time üòÇüòÇ. Nothing to add for today.

08/10/2019
---
Today it was a little better. I wasn't in a rush at work and had some free time üòé. Arghh... Lately I have a weird problem. After the morning bath my legs itch me! üò´ It's so annoying üò°!

09/10/2019
---
Another tough day ü§ê. I found a bug in our system that is so dumb -  communication has definitely failed  üò≠üò≠ - that I need to browse the repo, commit after commit and ask a lot of questions to people who made it üôÉ

10/10/2019
---
Human nature is really strange... we know that something is good and will give us profit in the future but instead we choose bad things. Why? ü§îü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

11/10/2019
---
Hi üëã! It's weekend finally!! I think this week was very exhausting and I'm a little tired. Today with friends we went on pool and afterwards we went to eat some fast food üçó

12/10/2019
---
Honestly? I wasted most of the day. Instead of doing things for studies or something I like, I decided to work... üòì I should be ashamed and this is a lesson for me - don't do work after work ü§®

13/10/2019
---
It was a quite nice Sunday :). I visited my friends, been at the church, watched F1 and went to Bialystok. Quite good..

14/10/2019
---
Good Monday! I did a good work (finally closed the topic that I had since Wednesday...), I've been at the University and did some work on my presentation about design patterns üëèüëç 

15/10/2019
---
Yay! It was a cool day! üòé I didn't have to go to the University and I was productive at work + I had some free time to do some tasks for studies üí™.

16/10/2019
---
It was another good day. Surprisingly this week is really good for me and thanks God for that üôè. Today I've met with friends from church. We were singing songs, praying together and talking ‚ò∫Ô∏è. I've met new person and it was a nice time :)

17/10/2019
---
What a crazy day it was üòÖ. I finished my work at 9 PM! But it's all ok because during the day I had to be on studies + I was also traveling (drove home) üôÇ. 

18/10/2019
---
Few times I've been thinking whether all this short notes makes any sense ü§î... Well, I don't have answer to that yet but since over a year this's my morning routine I don't want to break it ‚úã

19/10/2019
---
Another good day :). I did some homework for studies + I got invited on wedding üë∞ü§µ. I wrote about my friend who got engaged about a month ago. They invited me and all my family to the wedding :). I'm happy about this and I want to go there!

20/10/2019
---
Thank you God for that wonderful Sunday. We were celebrating thanksgiving holiday at our church. We had dinner and it was a good time that we spent together. ü¶Éü•ï

21/10/2019
---
Mooonday! Who hates Mondays‚ùìI don't! Of course, it would be perfect to have a longer weekend but if I like my job it's not like: 'arghhhh.. 5 days until the weekend again'. Try to like your job and Monday will be a pleasure for you! üî•‚ù§

22/10/2019
---
I spoke to one of my teachers today and I don't have to attend his workshops üòéüòé. Of course I have to do everything other students do but I can do it from my home :)!

23/10/2019
---
Today I started training on clean code & writing good tests. After the training, I met our trainer and went out to a local meeting of a java group called jsession. A lot of knowledge for one day! üëçüî•

24/10/2019
---
Second day of training. It was quite better - we talked about tdd and practiced it üë®üèª üíª. I spent the second part of the day studying and doing projects for studies.. Sounds interesting, huh? üôÑ

25/10/2019
---
Last day of training üôÑ. I knew about most of the things that the trainer told us, but I still treat this training as valuable because I learned some details üëç

26/10/2019
---
Today I've been at the [DevForge](https://www.facebook.com/KonferencjaDevForge/) conference in Bialystok. Presentations on the conference was technically advanced and had high quality üî•üëç‚ù§. As always after conferences now there are some aspects to think about in my career...ü§î

27/10/2019
---
I realized that I lost motivation for studies and for a work. I really like to study and for sure I like my job, but something is wrong... maybe I'm too overwhelmed? ü§Ø

28/10/2019
---
Monday :) I did a good job at work and finally almost finished bug that follow me for a few days. I think that that's the reason why I lost motivation for a work üôÑ. Btw. I practiced TDD today and it was quite fun üòâ

29/10/2019
---
Today I worked in an office - recently I started to like work from there üòÆ. I also started a new morning routine - morning workout - 4 times a week üí™. I've been doing it for two days and after these workouts I felt great üëä!

30/10/2019
---
Today I had fasting. It is tough to not eat a whole day... and what if some people doing that for few days ü§Ø? It's amazing feeling and I want to do that every month.

31/10/2019
---
Last day of October ‚ò∫Ô∏è. I practice cold showers for a few days in the morning after workouts üíßüíß. It's very stimulating - you have more energy and enjoy when the shower is over üòÇ!

01/11/2019
---
Yohoo, it's November already üòÄüôå! Today was my dad's birthday. He invited the whole family and we celebrated üéà. There were many cakes üéÇ, gifts üéÅand valuable conversations üòä.

02/11/2019
---
I spent most of this autumn Saturday doing one of my university projects. But in the evening I went to the swimming pool with my friends - it was very fun üòÖ. I really like and appreciate such moments üòç.

03/11/2019
---
It was wonderful Sunday üòä‚òÄÔ∏è. I had a lot of fun with my nephew.. :)

04/11/2019
---
Work üíª -> Studies üßë‚Äçüéì -> Work üî®... Yeah, it's Monday! :D I have to get used to it for a few months :)

05/11/2019
---
I don't know if I'm stupid or hardworking. I spent the whole day on the code refactor. I could just fix the bug and do something more interesting but I choose to refactor the code for 12 hours.. Is it passion or beeing dumb? ü§îü§î

06/11/2019
---
Today after work and study I visited my friend. There were some people there. It was a good time üëç

07/11/2019
---
Home sweet home :). Today I went back to my parents house. I feel great in here ‚ù§. I love the nature and everything around here üòä

08/11/2019
---
If you follow someone and someone's ideas you probably won't succeed like that person. I don't know why but this sentence follows me and I had to write it somewhere ‚úçüèΩüìì

09/11/2019
---
It was a crazy day! At the end of the day everything in my head was in English üòÇ. This is because all day I read one of the chapters of the book Reactive Programming written by Tomasz Nurkiewicz. The book itself is very interesting! üìö

10/11/2019
---
Sunday, Sunday üòè. Today I had a little thoughts that I write daily notes here for over a year üò≤. Quite nice, right ?

11/11/2019
---
Today was a national holiday in Poland so I didn't have to go to work üôÇ. Instead, I worked on university assignments all day. I have several projects to do in this semester ü§®. 

12/11/2019
---
ARghhh... I lost the whole day üò•. Well.. maybe it's not completely lost because I spent this time with my parents. Our ordered furnitures arrived today and we started to assemble them. It literally took us all afternoon and evening ü§Ø.

13/11/2019
---
Like a week earlier, today I visited my friend üôÇ. Actually, every week we have meetings with a group of people from our religion. At this meetings we talk about God, pray and sing songs.

14/11/2019
---
It was a busy day üò•. Work -> studies -> work -> studies -> and finally drive home ü§Ø. I have idea for a business - to help people to organize their life by using all the technology we have. It may sound stupid but there are so many people that aren't aware of all the applications that can help them everyday! 

15/11/2019
---
Today after work I went out with my friends on pool. We had a lot of fun üòÖ.

16/11/2019
---
I feel like I'm missing something in my life... I don't even know how to describe that feeling. I need to do fasting on Wednesday and pray God to give me an answer and change something my life üôè.

17/11/2019
---
Today is Sunday üòä. Since today I start drinking green tea instead of black tea. I read that it's healthier and better for teeth ü§©. Beside that - it was a normal Sunday. I've been at the church, we had familly dinner and I watched F1 :).

18/11/2019
---
Lately I have big issues with waking up..üò¥When my alarm rings, all I do is turn it off and say to myself - OK, 2 more minutes. And guess what. I wake up after 2 hours üò≤.

19/11/2019
---
I found a solution to my waking problem. I keep my alarm clock in the next room so I have to get up and thanks to that I feel a bit awake üòé. Today I conducted classes at the University of technology in Bialystok on design patterns. Nice experience, I have one more lesson next week üëç.

20/11/2019
---
That was a good day. My idea of keeping the alarm clock in the next room works üëç. Today I decided to fast - I have my personal reasons for that üòâ.

21/11/2019
---
I forgot that today I have no classes and I realized this when I stood in front of the classroom door üòÖ. Nothing bad happened I just went to my hometown earlier ;)

22/11/2019
---
Bam bam bam Friday ü§ó! I felt so good at work today. Time passed so quickly that I didn't even feel like I was at work (maybe because I worked from home? üòé).

23/11/2019
---
It was another day of study - I spent almost the whole Saturday learning. In the evening I went out to the swimming pool with my cousin üèä.

24/11/2019
---
I feel like I chose wrong today. My friend offered me to went out for a concert but I decided to stay home and do projects ü§î. It was wrong 	choice - next time I won't refuse!

25/11/2019
---
I was so tired that I got up late üò¥. I didn't feel well most of the day - I had a strange headache. Maybe it was unconscious stress before tomorrow? Tomorrow I'll teach again at the University of Technology about the object-oriented design patterns.

26/11/2019
---
Mission accomplished üòé. I gave a lectures with a great success (I guess). 95% of studens told they were glad about classes we had. I feel motivated to act now. In 2020 I have to do something to bring value for students (blog for studens, hmm?).

27/11/2019
---
My alarm clock rule works! Keeping an alarm clock in the next room is a great idea üëç. Today I was in the office all day. After work I just ate something and went to sleep üò¥. I was literally tired..

28/11/2019
---
I had a quite nice day :). I'm not really sure what I can write after over a year of writing in here.. My days are very often the same üôÑ. What to write to get people being interested in? ü§î

29/11/2019
---
Friiiday üòç. You know what?! I feel like I've already done most of the work... I mean: I don't have any urgent study projects or any urgent tasks at work. It feels good... freedom üëç. I'm slowly starting to think about planning 2020 - there's only a month left until the next year üòè.

30/11/2019
---
I came up with some great ideas tonight üí°. One of them is to create a podcast in which I can talk with influencers (youtubers/streamers/others) about their lives. Another idea is more about me - I decided that in the last week of December I wouldn't write daily notes until the end of the year. Instead I'll read everything I wrote in 2019 and write a review of 2019 ‚úçÔ∏èüìì.

WooW, it's December already üò±. It was nice Sunday. I worked a little bit (on Friday I'm going on wedding so that are exchange hours). I feel fine, but for the future - always disable all work communicators on Sunday - that's a day for the God!

I have terrible feeling that I didn't do anything valuable at work üò®. I spent a lot of time on very weird bug with one of my colleague... but after 8 hours of work we realized that we are at the same point where we started ü§Øü§Ø.

'Hello World' üòâ. I had a good day. Nothing special happened but I feel very well üòÆ. Thank God for that!

Long day, huh ü§§. Tomorrow we're going to the wedding üë∞ü§µ so I have to do most of the things from the todo list for today. I assume I won't have time to do it there... ;). I hope to meet new people üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë

Today, together with my parents we went to Silesia. It was 6 hours drive by car and I was a driver üöó. I'm literally tired....üò´ But thank God for the blessed journey.

Wedding day! It was fun. I met new people and frankly I'm too tired to write anything more.. üòÖ

Day 2 of celebrating üéà! The bride and groom organized a dinner and after that we all went to prayer together. I met a few people and had a good time ;)

Today we went back home... Our travel went really smoothly (5 hours drive). As the days before - I'm tired... üò©. I think that following week will be tough ü§î.

The week has begun!üòé I had really tough Monday - mainly at work... I'm currently doing a task (bugfix) which is not trivial and very non-deterministic. I believe God will help me with that üòä.

This day was completely  opposite to the previous one. I had a lot to do at work, but I was 100% focused and the work went very well. Maybe it was because I was working in the client's office today? ü§®

Wednesday - I fasted today ü§´. In the evening I went to a friend of mine - people from our church was there. We talked, prayed and generally had a good time üëç

Home, sweet home ü§ó. Today I backed home and went to the pool with my cousin. Additionally I found finally how to use my 3rd monitor and now I work on 3 monitors! üòäüñ•Ô∏è

Friday, yohoo ü§óü§ó! It was really good day. I did a few tasks at work and felt very productive üëç. I also wasted a lot of time on youtube - I'm not proud of it but I don't feel bad. Sometimes I have to reset myself and I think that's what makes works for me üòè.

And the next day is history.. ;) Despite Saturday, I also worked today. On Friday, my superior asked me if I could work at the weekend and I said that Saturday was okay - and I did. Nobody bothers you, you do your job üòé - that's how you can work.

It was a really good Sunday üí™. I could be in church in the morning and in the evening. And in the evening, after the service, our friends who married a week ago and I was there at the wedding visited us. Thank God for this time üòâ.

And one more day God gave me to live ;). Today after work I had some kind of headache and I didn't feel the best üò©. So in the evening - altogether with my cousin - we went to the pool. üëç

I think that since the next year I'll stop writing daily notes. To be honest? I accomplished what I wanted to and I think it doesn't bring more value to me üòí.

18/12/2019

Today I'm very busy (as usual üòÖ) and my day looked like the previous one..

19/12/2019

I'm back home. Now I'll have a looong break from my studies - I won't return there until 2020 ü§Ø. Time flies so quickly üò¶üò±

I don't feel this Christmas at all...üò• The weather looks like autumn, there is no snow and it's quite warm for December. I'm sad and little angry about it üò§üò§!

Today one of my cousins came back from Germany. We celebrated it and went to the pool üòÑ.

22/12/2019

It's almost Christmas üéÑ and for real - I don't feel it üòë. I want snow...‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è

I was at the pool with my friends today. We had a lot of fun and it was a good relax after a whole day of work üëç‚ò∫Ô∏è.

Christmas Eve Day üéÑüéÅ. I'm happy and sad at the same time ü§®. I'm happy because it's Christmas but sad because there is no snow outside the window... I love snowy Christmas but anyway to all of you - remember that Christmas is the time of God's birth and that is the most important in this holiday - not gifts :)!

Christmas :). I love this time and I think most of us also üòä. I wish you all a Merry Christmas! ‚ù§

Boxing Day - I found out that in the USA they don't celebrate the 2nd Christmas day and they call it 'Boxing day'. For me - it was a good day üòâ.

Today we organized a bachelor party with friends for our friend who's getting married in 3 weeks üéàüéâ! We went to the pool and then to the pizza. It was rather a quiet party and it was about being able to have a good time with valuable conversations.

28/12/2019

It was a productive and powerful day üòé! First, I started by buying a host and domain name [bdabek.pl](https://bdabek.pl/), then I did a project for my studies and in the evening I went to the church youth meeting üëçüëç.

I'm not quite happy with how I spent this Sunday üôÑ. I should have met with friends but instead I chose a computer and studying... I'm mad at myself üò§!

30/12/2019

I read 1/3 of my 2019 daily notes and weekly reviews today. It's worth having these notes, because in December we forget about many of the little things that made us happy during this year üò≤ü§õ!

It's the last day of this year! üéÜüéÜ Thank you for being with me and wish you all the best in 2020 üòä!
