It's the first day of the year. My wife felt bad in the morning so she didn't go to church, but I did - alone. We spent New Year's Eve in Dubicze - it was nice, but to be honest it's not my vibe 🤫

Sunday was quite nice 😉. After the morning service my wife and I made lunch and right after we ate we had unexpected guests 😊 - Estera, Radek and their kids!

This day was a busy one. I worked until very late.. 😰. My wife was mad on me because of that, but.. at least in the evening we had honest talk.

Like yesterday, I had a lot of work 🥵. In the afternoon, my friend Marek and I met up and went for a run 🏃👍. Then my wife made me delicious homemade burgers 🍔❤️

My wife has a birthday today ❤️. I took her to a restaurant and we had a good dinner 😘. When we got home around 6 pm, something very strange happened to my dad - he lost some kind of consciousness and an ambulance took him to a hospital in Bialystok 🥺

It was very tough day 😓😓. My dad is in the hospital and doctors have no idea what is wrong with him 😶. I couldn't work and focus today 😞

I missed one day of daily notes - it happens 😏. I guess the best news is that things are better with my dad 😍😍! I'm very thankful to God!!
