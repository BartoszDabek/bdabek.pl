19/07/2023
---
On the one hand, a good day, on the other, small evening misunderstandings with my wife meant that the whole thing can be crossed out 😣. I would love for us to have more common passions, and we are very different 😩.

20/07/2023
---
I managed to book a dental check-up for tomorrow and additionally booked airport parking for our holiday.

21/07/2023
