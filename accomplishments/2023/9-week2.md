## 📝 Next week

### ⭐Summary
This was probably the worst week in terms of (un)done things. Firstly, I had no motivation to do it and secondly, in my mind I was already a bit on vacation. I also started walking with my wife in the morning and these were the places where I did something sporty and listened to podcasts. Oh well... I'll bounce back after the holidays :).
