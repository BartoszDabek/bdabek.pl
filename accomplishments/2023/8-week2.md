### ⭐Summary
It's exceptionally early as I write this week's summary because it's Friday evening. It's nice weather, my wife is cleaning the house and I'm sitting in front of the computer 😉. I wonder about life 😅😅. But seriously, I want to get to grips with the whole list earlier, so that I can have peace of mind on Sunday morning (since I have time for it anyway). Most things were done - only we didn't get the details of the woodwork, but I looked for some 'potential' contractors during the week. In addition, work, work, work and our house construction 😏. The roof team has finished covering the main roof and I must admit that it looks cool 🙂! This week I also managed to complete my sports goal of running 365 km in a year 🏃🥳🥳!
