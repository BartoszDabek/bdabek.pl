### ⭐Summary
I have definitely not read enough this week 🫣. I also had a terribly hard time getting up - I usually get up around 6:30am (there's a difference compared to 5am 😏). I managed to get some of the important stuff done ( exit to the property), so I'm happy with that 👍. Thanks to God for everything He gives us in life - whether good or worse - He is King and has power over everything 😉 !
