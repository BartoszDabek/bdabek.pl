### ⭐Summary
I think I'm starting to get lazy 😣... Another week in a row, and I haven't completed half of the planned tasks 🤔. I could make excuses for myself, but there are none. It's just that when I have some free time, instead of reading something, I waste my time... It's time to change something, Bartek! 🫵
